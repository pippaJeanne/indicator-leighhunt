<head type="header" rend="center uppercase">Deaths of Little Children.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Grecian</hi> philosopher being asked why he wept for the death of 
his son, since the sorrow was in vain, replied, <q type="spoken">I weep on that very
account.</q> And his answer became his wisdom. It is only for sophists
to pretend that we, whose eyes contain the fountains of tears, need 
never give way to them. It would be unwise not to do so on some 
occasions. Sorrow unlocks them in her balmy moods. The first 
bursts may be bitter and overwhelming; but the soil, on which they 
pour, would be the worse without them. They refresh the fever of the 
soul,—the dry misery, which parches the countenance into furrows, 
and renders us liable to our most terrible <q type="soCalled">flesh-quakes.</q></p>

<p>There are sorrows, it is true, so great, that to give them some of the 
ordinary vents is to run a hazard of being overthrown. These we 
must rather strengthen ourselves to resist; or bow quietly and drily 
down, in order to let them pass over us, as the traveller does the wind 
of the desert. But where we feel that tears would relieve us, it is
false philosophy to deny ourselves at least that first refreshment; and 
it is always false consolation to tell people that because they cannot 
help a thing, they are not to mind it. The true way is, to let them 
grapple with the unavoidable sorrow, and try to win it into gentleness 
by a reasonable yielding. There are griefs so gentle in their very 
nature, that it would be worse than false heroism to refuse them a tear. 
Of this kind are the deaths of infants. Particular circumstances may 
render it more or less advisable to indulge in grief for the loss of a 
little child; but in general, parents should be no more advised to repress 
their first tears on such an occasion, than to repress their smiles 
towards a child surviving, or to indulge in any other sympathy. It is 
an appeal to the same gentle tenderness; and such appeals are never 
made in vain. The end of them is an acquittal from the harsher bonds 

<pb n="202"/>

of affliction,—from the tying down of the spirit to one melancholy 
idea. </p>

<p>It is the nature of tears of this kind, howerer strongly they may 
gush forth, to run into quiet waters at last. We cannot easily, for 
the whole course of our lives, think with pain of any good and kind person 
whom we have lost. It is the divine nature of their qualities to 
conquer pain and death itself; to turn the memory of them into pleasure; 
to survive with a placid aspect in our imaginations. We are 
writing, at this moment, just opposite a spot which contains the 
grave of one inexpressibly dear to us. We see from our window the 
trees about it, and the church-spire. The green fields lie around. 
The clouds are travelling over head, alternately taking away the sunshine 
and restoring it. The vernal winds, piping of the flowery 
summer-time, are nevertheless calling to mind the far distant and dangerous 
ocean, which the heart that lies in that grave had many reasons 
to think of. And yet the sight of this spot does not give us pain. So 
far from it, it is the existence of that grave which doubles every charm 
of the spot; which links the pleasures of our childhood and manhood 
together; which puts a hushing tenderness in the winds, and a patient 
joy upon the landscape; which seems to unite heaven and earth, mortality 
and immortality, the grass of the tomb and the grass of the 
green field, and gives a more maternal aspect to the whole kindness of 
nature. It does not hinder gaiety itself. Happiness was what <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> 
tenant, through all her troubles, would have diffused. To diffuse 
happiness, and to enjoy it, is not only carrying on her wishes, but 
realizing her hopes; and gaiety, freed from <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> only pollutions, 
malignity and want of sympathy, is but a child playing about the 
knees of <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> mother. </p>

<p>The remembered innocence and endearments of a child stand us instead
of virtues that have died older. Children have not exercised the
voluntary offices of friendship; they have not chosen to be kind and
good to us; nor stood by us, from conscious will, in the hour of adversity,
But they have shared their pleasures and pains with us as well
as they could: the interchange of good offices between us has, of
necessity, been less mingled with the troubles of the world; the
sorrow arising from their death is the only one, which we can associate
with their memories. These are happy thoughts that cannot
die. Our loss may always render them pensive; but they will not
always be painful. It is a part of the benignity of Nature, that pain
does not survive like pleasure, at any time; much less where the cause
of it is an innocent one. The smile will remain reflected by memory;
as the moon reflects the light upon us, when the sun has gone into
heaven. </p>

<p>When writers like ourselves quarrel with earthly pain, (we mean 
writers of the same intentions, without implying, of course, any thing 
about abilities or otherwise) they are misunderstood if they are supposed 
to quarrel with pains of every sort. This would be idle and 
effeminate. They do not pretend indeed, that humanity might not 
wish, if it could, to be entirely free from pain; for it endeavours at all 

<pb n="203"/>

times to turn pain into pleasure, or at least to set off the one with the 
other; to make the former a zest, and the latter a refreshment. The 
most unaffected dignity of suffering does this; and if wise, acknowledges 
it. The greatest benevolence towards others, the most unselfish 
relish of their pleasures, even at <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> own expense, does but look to 
<choice><corr>increasing</corr><sic>encreasing</sic></choice> the general stock of happiness, though content, if it could, 
to have <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> identity swallowed up in that splendid contemplation. 
We are far from meaning that this is to be called selfishness. We are 
far indeed from thinking so, or of so confounding words. But neither 
is it to be called pain, when most unselfish; if disinterestedness be truly 
understood. The pain that is in it softens into pleasure, as the darker 
hue of the rainbow melts into the brighter. Yet even if a harsher line 
is to be drawn between the pain and pleasure of the most unselfish 
mind, (and ill health, for instance, may draw it), we should not quarrel 
with it, if it contributed to the general mass of comfort, and were of a 
nature which general kindliness could not avoid. Made as we are, 
there are certain pains, without which it would be difficult to conceive 
certain great and overbalancing pleasures. We may conceive 
it possible for beings to be made entirely happy: but in our 
composition, something of pain seems to be a necessary ingredient, in 
order that the materials may turn to as fine account as possible; 
though our clay, in the course of ages and experience, may be refined 
more and more. We may get rid of the worst earth, though not of 
earth itself. </p>

<p>Now the liability to the loss of children,—or rather what renders 
us sensible of it, the occasional loss itself,—seems to be one of 
these necessary bitters thrown into the cup of humanity. We do not 
mean that every body must lose one of his children, in order to enjoy 
the rest; or that every individual loss afflicts us in the same proportion. 
We allude to the deaths of infants in general. These might be as few 
as we could render them. But if none at all ever took place, we 
should regard every little child as a man or woman secured; and it 
will easily be conceived, what a world of endearing cares and hopes 
this security would endanger. The very idea of infancy would lose 
<choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> continuity with us. Girls and boys would be future men and 
women, not present children. They would have attained their full 
growth in our imaginations, and might as well have been men and 
women at once. On the other hand, those who have lost an infant, 
are never, as it were, without an infant child. They are the only
persons, who, in one sense, retain it always; and they furnish their
neighbours with the same idea.<note type="hunt">

The Story of <persName type="fictional" key="Cyllarus" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyllarus">Cyllarus</persName> and <persName type="fictional" key="Hylonome" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Hylonome">Hylonome</persName>.</head>

<p>It is not one of the least instances of the force of habit, to see how 
poetry and mythology can reconcile us to shapes, or rather combinations 
of shape, unlike any thing in nature. The dog-headed deities of 
the Egyptians were doubtless not so monstrous in their eyes, as in 
ours. The Centaurs of the Greeks, as we shall see presently, could 
be imagined possessing beauty enough for a sort of human love-story: 
and our imaginations find nothing at all monstrous in the idea of an 
angel, though it partakes of the nature of the bird. The angel, it is 
true, is the least departure from humanity. <choice><orig>It's</orig><reg>Its</reg></choice> wings are not an 
alteration of the human shape, but an addition to it. Yet, leaving a 
more awful wonder out of the question, we should be startled to find 
pinions growing out of the shoulder-blades of a child; and we should
wait with anxiety to see of what nature the pinions were, till we became
reconciled to them. If they turned out to be ribbed and webbed 
like those of the imaginary dragon, conceive the horror. If, on the 
other hand, they became feathers, and tapered off like those of a 
gigantic bird, comprising also grace and splendour as well as the power 
of flight, we can easily fancy ourselves reconciled to them. And yet 
again, on the other hand, the Flying Women, described in the <title key="The Life and Adventures Of Peter Wilkins" level="m" ref="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+life+and+adventures+of+peter+wilkins">Adventures 
of Peter Wilkins</title><note type="editorial">Hunt here refers to The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins by Robert Paltock published in 1751</note>, do not shock us, though their wings partake 
of the ribbed and webbed nature, and not at all of the feathered. We 
admire <persName type="fictional" key="Peter Wilkins">Peter</persName>'s gentle and beautiful bride, notwithstanding the phenomenon 
of the Graundee, <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> light whalebone-like intersections, and <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> power of dropping about her like drapery. It even becomes a 
matter of pleasant curiosity. We find it not at all in the way. We 
can readily apprehend the delight he felt at possessing a creature so 
kind and sensitive; and can sympathize with him in the happiness of that 
bridal evening, equally removed from prudery and grossness, which 
he describes with a mixture of sentiment and voluptuousness beyond 
all the bridals we ever read. </p>

<pb n="205"/>

<p>To imagine any thing like a sympathy of this kind, it is of course 
necessary that the difference of form should consist in addition, and 
not in alteration. But the un-angel-like texture of the flying apparatus 
of fair <persName type="fictional" key="Youwarkee">Youwarkee</persName> (such, if we remember, is her name) helps to 
<choice><corr>show</corr><sic>shew</sic></choice> us the main reason why we are able to receive pleasure from the 
histories of creatures only half-human. The habit of reading prevents 
the first shock; but we are reconciled in proportion to their possession 
of what we are pleased to call human qualities. Kindness is 
the great elevator. The Centaurs may have killed all the Lapithæ, 
and <choice><corr>shown</corr><sic>shewn</sic></choice> considerable generalship to boot, without reconciling us to 
the brute part of them; but the brutality melts away before the story 
of their two lovers in <persName key="Ovid" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ovid" type="real">Ovid</persName>. Drunkenness and rapine make beasts of 
them;—sentiment makes human beings. <persName type="fictional" key="Polyphemus" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polyphemus">Polyphemus</persName> in <persName key="Homer" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" type="real">Homer</persName> 
is a shocking monster, not because he has only one eye, but because he 
murders and eats our fellow-creatures. But in <persName key="Theocritus" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocritus" type="real">Theocritus</persName>, where he 
is <persName type="fictional" key="Galatea" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Galatea_(Greek_myth)">Galatea</persName>'s lover, and sits hopelessly lamenting his passion, we only 
pity him. His deformity even increases our pity. We blink the question
of beauty, and become one-eyed for his sake. Nature seems to 
do him an injustice in gifting him with sympathies so human, and at 
the same time preventing them from being answered: and we feel impatient 
with the all-beautiful <persName type="fictional" key="Galatea">Galatea</persName>, if we think she ever <choice><corr>showed</corr><sic>shewed</sic></choice> 
him scorn as well as unwillingness. We insist upon her avoiding him 
with the greatest possible respect. </p>

<p>These fictions of the poets therefore, besides the mere excitement 
which they give the imagination, assist remotely to break the averseness 
and uncharitableness of human pride. And they may blunt the 
point of some fancies that are apt to come upon melancholy minds. 
When <persName key="Sir Thomas Browne" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Browne" type="real">Sir Thomas Brown</persName>, in the infinite range of his metaphysical 
optics, turned his glass, as he no doubt often did, towards the inhabitants 
of other worlds, the stories of angels and Centaurs would help 
his imaginative good nature to a more willing conception of creatures 
in other planets unlike those on earth; to other <q type="soCalled">lords of creation;</q> 
and other, and perhaps nobler humanities, nobler in spirit, though 
differing in form. If indeed there can be any thing in the starry endlessness 
of existence, nobler than what we can conceive of love and
generosity. </p>

<p>But to our story. <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>, in one of the finest parts of his <title level="m">Metamorphoses</title>, 
has recounted the famous battle of the Centaurs and Lapithæ. 
Our countrymen have the happiness of possessing, in another 
shape, another fine poem on the same subject; we mean the divine 
sculptures of <persName key="Phidias">Phidias</persName>.
<note type="hunt"> We never observed till the other day, that in these Marbles the Centaurs are 
no taller than the Lapithæ. Upon thinking of the matter, we believe it is also the 
same in most engravings, where Centaurs are introduced; certainly in some old 
ones. We are to imagine of course, not that the Centaurs were of the same height 
as men of <q type="soCalled">this degenerate age,</q> and ran about with Welch ponies behind them, 
but that they and the Lapithæ were of gigantic stature, and the horse-part as large 
as the finest of our modern steeds. An awkward difficulty seems still to remain; 
since the horse, however large, must be comparatively small to a horse fit for a 
Lapithite to ride. But the reader is to suppose, that there were no horses in those 
days to provoke the comparison. The notion of the <q type="distinct">half-horsie</q> people (as <persName key="Edmund Spenser">Spenser</persName>, 
in a true spirit of poetical composition, ventures to call them), originated in the 
wonder with which men on horse-back were first regarded. When the Mexicans 
first beheld Cortes and his cavalry, they were struck with the same
idea. </note> But <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName> is as powerful in his way, as the 

<pb n="206"/>

English reader may see in the versions of <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> and <persName key="George Sandys">Sandys</persName>. <persName key="Phidias">Phidias</persName> 
has relieved the ferocity of his story with some exquisite figures 
of women. One in particular, who seems fainting, is the very gentle 
essence of womanhood personified. <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>, more exuberant, though 
not more touching in his imagination, has carried the refinement farther; 
and contradicting, or rather varying, with a solitary and striking 
exception, the general character given of Centaurs, has introduced 
two of them as lovers, remarkable for their gentleness and beauty, 
and dying side by side. The story is, that <persName type="fictional" key="Pirithous">Pirithous</persName> having invited 
<q type="distinct">the half-horsie people</q> to his wedding-feast, when he married <persName type="fictional" key="Hippodamia">Hippodamia</persName>, 
one of them was so inflamed with the beauty of the bride, 
that he started up in the midst of the drinking and carousing, and attempted 
to carry her off. <persName type="fictional" key="Theseus">Theseus</persName>, the friend of <persName type="fictional" key="Pirithous">Pirithous</persName>, seized a 
great antique goblet, craggy with sculpture, and dashed his face to
shatters with it, so that he died. The other Centaurs, seeing their 
brother killed, grew frantic with revenge; and a tremendous battle 
ensued. The whole account fills the ear and the imagination, 
like an enormous uproar. It is a gigantic hubbub, full of huge 
fists, hoofs, weapons, and flying furniture, chandeliers torn down, 
and tables snatched up, shrieks of females, and roarings and tramplings 
of men and half-men. One of the Lapithæ makes nothing of 
rending away a door-post that would load a waggon: and a Centaur 
tears up an altar with fire upon it, and sends it blazing among the 
enemy. The difterent modes in which the deaths are inflicted are as 
various any in <persName key="Homer">Homer</persName>; and the poet, with admirable propriety, has 
given his battle all the additional interest, which the novelty of the 
figures engaged in it could suggest. </p>

<p>The episode of the two lovers comes but of all this hideous turbulence,
like the dropping of rain from the eaves after a thunder-storm.
If we are asked why we translate it after <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> and <persName key="George Sandys">Sandys</persName>, it will
be sufficient to answer that it gave us some pleasant moments to do so;
and that we would rather, on these occasions, furnish something original
to the reader than translated. But our readers and we are not
quarrelsome parties. With regard to the measure, we have chosen it
as the most capable of expressing the alternate laxity and compression,
for which <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>'s style is remarkable. We found the heroic couplet
hamper us, tending either to too great length or the reverse of
it. With the old ballad measure before us, one may do as one
pleases; and there is something in it that suits the simplicity of the
affections.</p>
