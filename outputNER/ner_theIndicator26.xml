                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Grecian</hi> philosopher being asked why he wept for
                        the death of his son, since the sorrow was in vain, replied, <q>I weep on
                        that very
                            account.</q> <persName key="And">And</persName> his answer became his wisdom. It is only for sophists
                        to pretend that we, whose eyes contain the fountains of tears, need never
                        give way to them. It would be unwise not to do so on some occasions. Sorrow
                        unlocks them in her balmy moods. The first bursts may be bitter and
                        overwhelming; but the soil, on which they pour, would be the worse without
                        them. They refresh the fever of the soul,—the dry misery, which parches the
                        countenance into furrows, and renders <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> liable to our most terrible <soCalled>
                        flesh-quakes.</soCalled> There are sorrows, it is true, so great, that to
                        give them some of the ordinary vents is to run a hazard of being overthrown.
                        These we m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t rather strengthen ourselves to resist; or bow quietly and
                        drily down, in order to let them pass over <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, as the traveller does the
                        wind of the desert. But where we feel that tears would relieve <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, if is
                        false philosophy to deny ourselves at least that first refreshment; and it
                        is always false consolation to tell people that beca<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e they cannot help a
                        thing, they are not to mind it. The true way is, to let them, grapple with
                        the unavoidable sorrow, and try to win it into gentleness by a reasonable
                        yielding. There are griefs so gentle in their very nature, that it would be
                        worse than false heroism to ref<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e them a tear. Of this kind are the deaths
                        of infants. Particular circumstances may render it more or less advisable to
                        indulge in grief for the loss of a little child; but in general, parents
                        should be no more advised to repress their first tears on such an occasion,
                        than to repress their smiles towards a child surviving, or to indulge in any
                        other sympathy. It is an appeal to the same gentle tenderness; and such
                        appeals are never made in vain. The end of them is an acquittal from the
                        harsher bonds <pb n="202" /> of affliction,—from the tying down of the
                        spirit to one melancholy idea. </p>
                    <p>It is the nature of tears of this kind, howerer strongly they may g<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>h forth,
                        to run into quiet waters at last. We cannot easily, for the whole course of
                        our lives, think with pain of any good and kind person whom we have lost. It
                        is the divine nature of their qualities to conquer pain and death itself; to
                        turn the memory of them into pleasure; to survive with a placid aspect in
                        our imaginations. We are writing, at this moment, j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t opposite a spot which
                        contains the grave of one inexpressibly dear to <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. We see from our window
                        the trees about it, and the church-spire. The green fields lie around. The
                        clouds are travelling over head, alternately taking away the sunshine and
                        restoring it. The vernal winds, piping of the flowery summer-time, are
                        nevertheless calling to mind the far distant and dangero<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> ocean, which the
                        heart that ires in that grave had many reasons to think of. <persName key="And">And</persName> yet the
                        sight of this spot does not give <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> pain. So far from it, it is the
                        existence of that grave which doubles every charm of the spot; which links
                        the pleasures of our childhood and manhood together; which puts a h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>hing
                        tenderness in the winds, and a patient joy upon the landscape; which seems
                        to unite heaven and earth, mortality and immortality, the grass of the tomb
                        and the grass of the green field, and gives a more maternal aspect to the
                        whole kindness of nature. It does not hinder gaiety itself. Happiness was
                        what <choice>

                        </choice> tenant, through all her
                        troubles, would have diff<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ed. To diff<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e happiness, and to enjoy it, is not
                        only carrying on her wishes, but realizing her hopes; and gaiety, freed from
                        it's only pollutions, malignity and want of sympathy, is but a child playing
                        about the knees of <choice>

                        </choice> mother. </p>
                    <p>The remembered innocence and endearments of a child stand <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> instead
                        of virtues that have died older. Children have not exercised the
                        voluntary offices of friendship; they have not chosen to be kind and
                        good to <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>; nor stood by <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, from conscio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> will, in the hour of adversity,
                        But they have shared their pleasures and pains with <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> as well
                        as they could: the interchange of good offices between <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> has, of
                        necessity, been less mingled with the troubles of the world; the
                        sorrow arising from their death is the only one, which we can associate
                        with their memories. These are happy thoughts that cannot
                        die. Our loss may always render them pensive; but they will not
                        always be painful. It is a part of the benignity of Nature, that pain
                        does not survive like pleasure, at any time; much less where the ca<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e
                        of it is an innocent one. The smile will remain reflected by memory;
                        as the moon reflects the light upon <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, when the sun has gone into
                        heaven. </p>
                    <p>When writers like ourselves quarrel with earthly pain, (we mean writers of
                        the same intentions, without implying, of course, any thing about abilities
                        or otherwise) they are misunderstood if they are supposed to quarrel with
                        pains of every sort. This would be idle and effeminate. They do not pretend
                        indeed, that humanity might not wish, if it could, to be entirely free from
                        pain; for it endeavours at all <pb n="203" /> times to turn pain into
                        pleasure, or at least to set off the one with the other; to make the former
                        a zest, and the latter a refreshment. The most unaffected dignity of
                        suffering does this; and if wise, acknowledges it. The greatest benevolence
                        towards others, the most unselfish relish of their pleasures, even at <choice>

                        of happiness, though content, if it could, to have <choice>

                        </choice> identity swallowed up
                        in that splendid contemplation. We are far from meaning that this is to be
                        called selfishness. We are far indeed from thinking so, or of so confounding
                        words. But neither is it to be called pain, when most unselfish; if
                        disinterestedness be truly understood. The pain that is in it softens into
                        pleasure, as the darker hue of the rainbow melts into the brighter. Yet even
                        if a harsher line is to be drawn between the pain and pleasure of the most
                        unselfish mind, (and ill health, for instance, may draw it), we should not
                        quarrel with it, if it contributed to the general mass of comfort, and were
                        of a nature which general kindliness could not avoid. Made as we are, there
                        are certain pains, without which it would be difficult to conceive certain
                        great and overbalancing pleasures. We may conceive it possible for beings to
                        be made entirely happy: but in our composition, something of pain seems to
                        be a necessary ingredient, in order that the materials may turn to as fine
                        account as possible; though our clay, in the course of ages and experience,
                        may be refined more and more. We may get rid of the worst earth, though not
                        of earth itself. </p>
                    <p>Now the liability to the loss of children,—or rather what renders <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> sensible
                        of it, the occasional loss itself,—seems to be one of these necessary
                        bitters thrown into the cup of humanity. We do not mean that every body m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t
                        lose one of his children, in order to enjoy the rest; or that every
                        individual loss afflicts <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> in the same proportion. We allude to the deaths
                        of infants in general. These might be as few as we could render them. But if
                        none at all ever took place, we should regard every little child as a man or
                        woman secured; and it will easily be conceived, what a world of endearing
                        cares and hopes this security would endanger. The very idea of infancy would
                        lose <choice>
                            <corr>its</corr>

                        Girls and boys would be future men and women, not present children. They
                        would have attained their full growth in our imaginations, and might as well
                        have been men and women at once. On the other hand, those who have lost an
                        infant, are never, as it were, without an infant child. They are the only
                        persons, who, in one sense, retain it always; and they furnish their
                        neighbours with the same idea.<note type="hunt">

                    <p>It is not one of the least instances of the force of habit, to see how poetry
                        and mythology can reconcile <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> to shapes, or rather combinations of shape,
                        unlike any thing in nature. The dog-headed deities of the Egyptians were
                        doubtless not so monstro<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> in their eyes, as in ours. The Centaurs of the
                        Greeks, as we shall see presently, could be imagined possessing beauty
                        enough for a sort of human love-story: and our imaginations find nothing at
                        all monstro<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> in the idea of an angel, though it partakes of the nature of
                        the bird. The angel, it is true, is the least departure from humanity. It's
                        wings are not an alteration of the human shape, but an addition to it. Yet,
                        leaving a more awful wonder out of the question, we should be startled to
                        find pinions growing out of the shoulder-blades of a child; and we should
                        wait with anxiety to see of what nature the pinions were, till we became
                        reconciled to them. If they turned out to be ribbed and webbed like those of
                        the imaginary dragon, conceive the horror. If, on the other hand, they
                        became feathers, and tapered off like those of a gigantic bird, comprising
                        also grace and splendour as well as the power of flight, we can easily fancy
                        ourselves reconciled to them. <persName key="And">And</persName> yet again, on the other hand, the Flying

                        human qualities. Kindness is the great elevator. The Centaurs may have

                        Drunkenness and rapine make beasts of them;—sentiment makes human beings.
                        Polyphem<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> in Homer is a shocking monster, not beca<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e he has only one eye,

                        of beauty, and become one-eyed for his sake. Nature seems to do him an

                    <p>These fictions of the poets therefore, besides the mere excitement which they
                        give the imagination, assist remotely to break the averseness and
                        uncharitableness of human pride. <persName key="And">And</persName> they may blunt the point of some
                        fancies that are apt to come upon melancholy minds. When Sir <persName key="Thomas Brown">Thomas Brown</persName>,
                        in the infinite range of his metaphysical optics, turned his glass, as he no
                        doubt often did, towards the inhabitants of other worlds, the stories of
                        angels and Centaurs would help his imaginative good nature to a more willing
                        conception of creatures in other planets unlike those on earth; to other <q>lords
                        of creation;</q> and other, and perhaps nobler humanities, nobler in spirit,
                        though differing in form. If indeed there can be any thing in the starry
                        endlessness of existence, nobler than what we can conceive of love and
                        generosity. </p>
                    <p>But to our story. <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>, in one of the finest parts of his Metamorphoses, has
                        recounted the famo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> battle of the Centaurs and <placeName key='Lapithae'>Lapithae</placeName>. Our countrymen
                        have the happiness of possessing, in another shape, another fine poem on the
                        same subject; we mean the divine sculptures of <persName key="Phidias">Phidias</persName>.<note type="hunt"> We
                        never observed till the other day, that in these Marbles the Centaurs are no
                        taller than the <placeName key='Lapithae'>Lapithae</placeName>. Upon thinking of the matter, we believe it is also
                        the same in most engravings, where Centaurs are introduced; certainly in
                        some old ones. We are to imagine of course, not that the Centaurs were of
                        the same height as men of <q>this degenerate age,</q> and ran about with
                        Welch ponies behind them, but that they and the <placeName key='Lapithae'>Lapithae</placeName> were of gigantic
                        stature, and the horse-part as large as the finest of our modern steeds. An
                        awkward difficulty seems still to remain; since the horse, however large,
                        m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t be comparatively small to a horse fit for a Lapithite to ride. But the
                        reader is to suppose, that there were no horses in those days to provoke the
                        comparison. The notion of the <q>half-horsie</q> people (as Spenser, in a
                        true spirit of poetical composition, ventures to call them), originated in
                        the wonder with which men on horse-back were first regarded. When the
                        Mexicans first beheld Cortes and his cavalry, they were struck with the same
                        idea. </note> But <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName> is as powerful in his way, as the <pb n="206" />
                        English reader may see in the versions of <persName key="Dryden">Dryden</persName> and <persName key="Sandys">Sandys</persName>. <persName key="Phidias">Phidias</persName> has
                        relieved the ferocity of his story with some exquisite figures of women. One
                        in particular, who seems fainting, is the very gentle essence of womanhood
                        personified. <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>, more exuberant, though not more touching in his
                        imagination, has carried the refinement farther; and contradicting, or
                        rather varying, with a solitary and striking exception, the general
                        character given of Centaurs, has introduced two of them as lovers,
                        remarkable for their gentleness and beauty, and dying side by side. The
                        story is, that Piritho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> having invited <q>the half-horsie people</q> to his
                        wedding-feast, when he married Hippodamia, one of them was so inflamed with
                        the beauty of the bride, that he started up in the midst of the drinking and
                        caro<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ing, and attempted to carry her off. These<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, the friend of Piritho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>,
                        seized a great antique goblet, craggy with sculpture, and dashed his face to
                        shatters with it, so that he died. The other Centaurs, seeing their brother
                        killed, grew frantic with revenge; and a tremendo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> battle ensued. The whole
                        account fills the ear and the imagination, like an enormo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> uproar. It is a
                        gigantic hubbub, full of huge fists, hoofs, weapons, and flying furniture,
                        chandeliers torn down, and tables snatched up, shrieks of females, and
                        roarings and tramplings of men and half-men. One of the <placeName key='Lapithae'>Lapithae</placeName> makes
                        nothing of rending away a door-post that would load a waggon: and a Centaur
                        tears up an altar with fire upon it, and sends it blazing among the enemy.
                        The difterent modes in which the deaths are inflicted are as vario<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> any in
                        Homer; and the poet, with admirable propriety, has given his battle all the
                        additional interest, which the novelty of the figures engaged in it could
                        suggest. </p>
                    <p>The episode of the two lovers comes but of all this hideo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> turbulence,
                        like the dropping of rain from the eaves after a thunder-storm.
                        If we are asked why we translate it after <persName key="Dryden">Dryden</persName> and <persName key="Sandys">Sandys</persName>, it will
                        be sufficient to answer that it gave <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> some pleasant moments to do so;
                        and that we would rather, on these occasions, furnish something original
                        to the reader than translated. But our readers and we are not
                        quarrelsome parties. With regard to the measure, we have chosen it
                        as the most capable of expressing the alternate laxity and compression,
                        for which <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>'s style is remarkable. We found the heroic couplet
                        hamper <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, tending either to too great length or the reverse of
                        it. With the old ballad measure before <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, one may do as one
                        pleases; and there is something in it that suits the simplicity of the
                        affections.</p>
