<p>Having met in the Harleian Miscellany with an account of a pet 
thief of ours, the famo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> Du Vail, who flourished in the time of Charles 
the Second, and wishing to introduce him worthily to the readers, 
it has brought to mind such a number of the light-fingered gentry, 
his predecessors, that we almost feel h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>tled by the thoughts of 
them. Our subject, we may truly fear, will run away with <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. 
We feel beset, like poor <persName key="Tasso">Tasso</persName> in his dungeon; and are not sure 
that our paper will not suddenly be conveyed away from under our 
pen. Already we miss some excellent remarks, which we should 
have made in this place. <persName key="I">I</persName>f the reader should meet with any of that 
kind hereafter, upon the like subject, in another man's writings, 
twenty to one they are stolen from <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, and ought to have enriched 
this our plundered exordium. He that steals an author's purse, may 
emphatically be said to steal trash; but he that filches from him 
his good things. <persName key="Alas">Alas</persName>, we thought our subject would be running 
away with <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. We m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t keep firm. We m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t put something 
heavier in our remarks, as the little thin <persName key="Grecian">Grecian</persName> philosopher <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ed to 
put lead in his pockets, lest the wind should steal him. </p>

<p>The more ruffianly crowd of thieves should go first, as pioneers; 
but they can hardly be looked upon as progenitors of our gentle Du 
Vail; and besides, with all their ferocity, some of them assume a  
grandeur, from standing in the remote shadows of antiquity. There was 
the famo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> son, for instance, of Vulcan and Med<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>a, whom <persName key="Virgil">Virgil</persName> 
calls the dire aspect of half-human Cac<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> — <persName key="Semihominis Caci">Semihominis Caci</persName> facies 
dira. (AEneid, B. 8, v. 194.) He was the Raw-head-and-bloody- 
bones of ancient fable. He lived in a cave by <placeName key='Mount Aventine'>Mount Aventine</placeName>, 
breathing out fiery smoke, and haunting king Evander's highway 
like the <placeName key='Apollyon'>Apollyon</placeName> of Pilgrim's Progress. </p>

<p>He stole some of the cows of <persName key="Hercules">Hercules</persName>, and dragged them backwards 
into his cave to prevent discovery; but the oxen happening to low, 
the cows answered them; and the demigod, detecting the miscreant 
in his cave, strangled him after a hard encounter. This is one of 
the earliest sharping tricks upon record. </p>

<p>Autolyc<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, the son of Mercury (after whom <persName key="Shakspeare">Shakspeare</persName> christened 
his merry rogue in the Winter's Tale) was a thief suitable to the 
greater airiness of his origin. He is said to have performed tricks, 
which m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t awake the envy even of horse-dealers; for in pretending 
to return a capital horse which he had stolen, he palmed upon the 
owners a sorry jade of an ass; which was gravely received by those 
flats of antiquity. Another time he went still farther; for having 
conveyed away a handsome bride, he sent in exchange an old lady 
elaborately hideo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>; yet the h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>band did not find out the trick, till 
he had got off. </p>

<p>Autolyc<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> himself however was outwitted by Sisyph<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, the son of 
AEol<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. Autolyc<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> was in the habit of stealing his neighbours cattle, 
and altering the marks upon them. Among others he stole some 
from Sisyph<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>; but notwithstanding his <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual precautions, he was 
astonished to find the latter come and pick out his oxen, as if nothing 
had happened. He had marked them under the hoof. Autolyc<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, it 
seems, had the <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual generosity of geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>; and was so pleased with 
this evidence of superior cunning, that some say he gave him in 
marriage his daughter <persName key="Anticlea">Anticlea</persName>, who was afterwards the wife of 
<persName key="Laertes">Laertes</persName>, the father of Ulysses. According to others however, he 
only favoured him with his daughter's.company for a time, a fashion 
not yet extinct in some primitive countries; and it was a reproach 
made against Ulysses, that <persName key="Laertes">Laertes</persName> was only his pretended, and 
Sisyph<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> his real father. Sisyph<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> has the credit of being the greatest 
knave of antiquity. His famo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> punishment in hell, of being compelled 
to roll a stone up a hill to all eternity, and seeing it always go 
down again, is attributed by some to a characteristic trait, which he 
could not help playing off upon <persName key="Pluto">Pluto</persName>. <persName key="I">I</persName>t was supposed by the 
ancients, that a man's ghost would wander in a melancholy manner 
upon the banks of the <persName key="<persName key="St">St</persName>yx"><persName key="St">St</persName>yx</persName>, as long as his corpse remained without 
burial. Sisyph<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> on his death-bed purposely charged his wife to 
leave him unburied; and then begged <persName key="Pluto">Pluto</persName>'s permission to go back 
to earth, on his parole, merely to punish her for so scandalo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, a 
neglect. Like the lawyer however, who contrived to let his hat fall 
inside the door of heaven, and got <persName key="St">St</persName>. <persName key="Peter">Peter</persName>'s permission to step in 
for it, Sisyph<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> would not return; and so when <persName key="Pluto">Pluto</persName> had him again, 
he paid him for the trick, with setting him upon this everlasting job. </p>

<p>The exploits of Mercury himself, the god of cunning, may be 
easily imagined to surpass every thing <choice><sic>atchieved</sic><corr>achieved</corr></choice> by profaner hands. 
Homer, in the Hymn to his honour, has given a delightful account 
of his pre-maturity in swindling. He had not been born many hours 
before he stole Vulcan's tools, Mars's sword, and Jupiter's sceptre. 
He beat Cupid in a wrestling bout on the same day; and Vei<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> 
caressing him for his conquest, he returned the embrace by filching 

<pb n="83"/>

away her girdle. He would also have stolen Jupiter's thunder-bolts 
but was afraid of burning his fingers. On the evening of his 
birthday, he drove off the cattle of Adoiet<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, which Apollo was tending. 
The good-humoured god of wit endeavoured to frighten him into 
restoring them; but could not help laughing, when in the midst of 
his threatenings he found himself without his quiver. </p>

<p>The history of thieves is to be found either in that of romance, or 
in the details of the history of cities. The latter have not come 
,down to <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> from the ancient world, with some exceptions in the 
comic writers, immaterial to our present purpose, and in the loathsome 
rhetoric of Petroni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, The finest thief in old history is the 
pirate who made that famo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> answer to <persName key="Alexander">Alexander</persName>, in which he said 
that the conqueror was only the mightier thief of the two. The story 
of the thieving architect in Herodot<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> we will tell another time. We can 
call to mind no other thieves in the Greek and Latin writers, (always 
excepting political ones) except some paltry fellows who stole napkins 
at dinner; and the robbers in Apulei<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, the precursors of those in 
<persName key="Gil Bias">Gil Bias</persName>. When we come however to the times of the Arabians and 
of chivalry, they abound in all their glory, both great and small. 
Who among <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> does not know by heart the story of the never-to-be- 
forgotten <placeName key='Forty Thieves'>Forty Thieves</placeName>, with their treasure in the green wood, their 
anxio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> observer, their magical opening of the door, their captain, 
their concealment in the jars, and the scalding oil, that, as it were, 
extinguished them groaning, one by one? Have we not all ridden 
backwards and forwards with them to the wood a hundred times? 
Watched them, with fear and trembling, from the tree? Sewn up, 
blindfolded, the four quarters of the dead body. <persName key="And">And</persName> said, "Open, 
Sesame," to every door at school?" May we ride with them again and 
again; or we shall lose our appetite for some of the best things in 
the world. </p>

<p>We pass over those interlopers in our English family, the <placeName key='Danes'>Danes</placeName>; 
as well as <persName key="Rollo the Norman">Rollo the Norman</persName>, and other freebooters, who only wanted 
less need of robbery, to become respectable conquerors. <persName key="I">I</persName>n fact they 
did so, as they got on. We have also no particular worthy to select 
from among that host of petty chieftains, who availed themselves of 
their knightly castles and privileges, to commit all sorts of 
unchivalro<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> outrages. These are the giants of modern romance; and the 
<persName key="Veglios">Veglios</persName>, <persName key="Malengins">Malengins</persName>, and <placeName key='Pinabellos'>Pinabellos</placeName>, of <placeName key='Pulci'>Pulci</placeName>, <placeName key='Spenser'>Spenser</placeName>, and <persName key="Ariosto">Ariosto</persName>. 
They survived in the petty states of <placeName key='<persName key="I">I</persName>taly'><persName key="I">I</persName>taly</placeName> a long while; gradually 
took a less solitary though hardly less ferocio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> shape among the 
fierce political partisans recorded by <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName>; and at length became 
represented by the men of desperate fortunes, who make such a 
figure, between the gloomy and the gallant, in <persName key="Mrs">Mrs</persName>, <persName key="Radcliffe">Radcliffe</persName>'s 
Mysteries of Udolpho. The breaking up of the late kingdom of 
<placeName key='<persName key="I">I</persName>taly'><persName key="I">I</persName>taly</placeName> with it's dependencies, has again revived them in some degree; 
but not, we believe, in any shape above common robbery. The 
regular modern thief seems to make his appearance for the first time, 
in the imaginary characteir of <placeName key='Brunello'>Brunello</placeName>, as described by <persName key="Boiardo">Boiardo</persName> and 
<persName key="Ariosto">Ariosto</persName>. He is a fellow that steals every valuable that comes in his 

<pb n="84"/>

way. The way in which he robs Sacripant King of Circassian of his 
horse, has been ridiculed by Cervantes; if indeed he did not rather 
repeat it with great zest; for his <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e of the theft is really not such 
a caricature as in <persName key="Boiardo">Boiardo</persName> and his great follower. While Sancho is 
sitting lumpishly asleep upon the back of his friend Dapple, Gines de 
Passanaonte, the famo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> thief, comes and gently withdraws the 
donkey from under him, leaving the somniculo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> squire propped up 
on the saddle with four sticks. His consternation on waking may be 
guessed. But in the <persName key="I">I</persName>talian poets, the Circassian prince has only 
fallen into a deep meditation, when <placeName key='Brunello'>Brunello</placeName> draws away his steed. 
<persName key="Ariosto">Ariosto</persName> appears to have thought this extravagance a hazardo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> one, 
though he could not deny himself the pleasure of repeating it 5 for 
he has made Sacripant bl<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>h, when called upon to testify how the 
horse was stolen from him. (Orlando Furio. c. 27. st. 84.) </p>

<p><persName key="I">I</persName>n the <persName key="I">I</persName>talian Novels and the old French Tales, are a variety of 
extremely am<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ing stories of thieves, till most probably founded on 
fact. We will give a specimen as we go, by way of making this 
article the completer. A doctor of laws in <placeName key='Bologna'>Bologna</placeName> had become rich 
enough, by scraping money together, to indulge himself in a grand 
silver cup, which he sent home one day to his wife from the <choice><orig>gold-smith's</orig><reg>goldsmith's</reg></choice>.  
There were two sharping fellows prowling about that day in 
search of a prize; and getting scent of the cup, they laid their heads 
together, to contrive how they might indulge themselves in it instead. 
One of them accordingly goes to a fishmonger's, and buys a fine 
lamprey, which he takes to the doctor's wife, with her h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>band's 
compliments, and he would bring a company of his brother doctors with 
him to dinner, requesting in the mean time that she would send back 
the cup, by the bearer, as he had forgotten to have his arms engraved 
upon it. The good lady, happy to obey all these pleasing impulses 
on the part of master doctor, takes in the fish and sends out the cup, 
with equal satisfaction; and sets about getting the dinner ready. 
The doctor comes home at his <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual hour, and finding his dinner so 
much better than ordinary, asks with an air of wonder, where was the 
necessity of going to that expense : upon which the wife, putting on an 
air of wonder in her turn, and proud of possessing the new cup, asks 
him where are all those brother doctors, whom he said he should 
bring with him. What does the fool mean? said the testy old 
gentleman. Mean! rejoined the wife : — what does this mean? pointing 
to the fish. The doctor looked down with his old eyes at the lamprey. 
"God knows," said he, "what it means. <persName key="I">I</persName> am sure <persName key="I">I</persName> don't know 
what it means, more than any other fish; except that <persName key="I">I</persName> shall have 
to pay a pretty sum for every mouthful you eat of it." " Why it 
was your own doing, h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>band," said the wife; "and you will 
remember it perhaps, when you recollect that the same man that 
brought me the fish, was to take away the cup to have your name 
engraved upon it." At this the doctor started back, with his eyes as 
wide open as the fish's, exclaming, "<persName key="And">And</persName> you gave it him, did you?" 
"To be sure <persName key="I">I</persName> did;" returned the good ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ewife. The old doctor 
here began a passionate speech, which he suddenly broke off; and 

<pb n="84"/>

after stamping up and down the room, and crying out that he was 
an undone advocate, ran quivering out into the street like one frantic, 
asking every body if he had seen a man with a lamprey. The two 
rogues were walking all this time in the neighbourhood; and seeing 
the doctor set off, in his frantic fit, to the goldsmith's, and knowing 
that he who brought the lamprey had been well disguised, they began 
to ask one another, in the jollity of their triumph, what need there 
was for losing a good lamprey, beca<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e they had gained a cup. The 
other therefore went to the doctor's ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e, and putting on a face of 
good news, told the wife that the cup was found. "Master doctor," 
said he, "bade me come and tell you that it was but a joke of your 
old friend What's-his-name." "Castellani, <persName key="I">I</persName> warrant me," said the 
wife, with a face broad with delight. "The same," returned he:— 
"master doctor says that Signor Castellani, and the other gentlemen 
he spoke of, are waiting for you at the Signor's ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e, 
where they purpose to laugh away the choler they so merrily raised 
with a good dinner and wine; and to that end they have sent me 
for the lamprey." "Take it in God's name," said the good woman; 
"<persName key="I">I</persName> am heartily glad to see it go out of the ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e, and shall follow it 
myself speedily." So saying, she gave him the fine hot fish, with some 
sauce, between two dishes; and the knave, who felt already round the 
corner with glee, slid it under his cloak, and made the best of his 
way to his companion, who lifted up his hands and eyes at sight of 
him, and asked twenty questions in a breath, and chuckled, and slapped 
his thigh, and snapped his fingers for joy, to think what a pair 
of fools two rogues had to do with. Little did the poor despairing 
doctor, on his return home, guess what they were saying of him as 
he passed the wall of the ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e in which they were feasting. Heyday! 
cried the wife, smiling all abroad, as she saw him entering, "What, 
are thou come to fetch me then, bone of my bone? Well; if this isn't 
the gallantest day <persName key="I">I</persName> have seen many a year! <persName key="I">I</persName>t puts me in mind — 
it puts me in mind — Here the chirping old lady was about to 
remind the doctor of the days of his youth, holding out her arms and 
raising her quivering voice, when (we shudder to relate) she received 
a considerable cuff on the left cheek. "You make me mad," cried 
the doctor," with your eternal idiotical nonsense. What do you 
mean by coming to fetch you, and the gallantest day of your life? 
May the devil fetch you, and me, and that invisible fiend that stole 
the cup." "What!" exclaimed the wife, suddenly changing her 
tone from a vocifero<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> complaint which she had unthinkingly set up, 
"did you send nobody then for the lamprey?" Here the doctor 
cast his eyes upon the bereaved table; and unable to bear the shame 
of this additional loss, however trivial, began tearing his hair and 
beard, and hopping about the room, giving his wife a new and scandalo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> 
epithet at every step, as if he was dancing to a catalogue of her 
imperfections. The story shook all the shoulders in <placeName key='Bologna'>Bologna</placeName> for a 
month after. </p>

<p>As we find, by the length to which this article has already reached, 
that we should otherwise be obliged to compress our recollections of 

<pb n="86"/>

Spanish, French, and English thieves into a compass that would squeeze 
them into the merest dry notices, we will postpone them at once to our 
next number; and relate another story from the same <persName key="I">I</persName>talian novelist 
that supplied our last.<note type="hunt" place="foot"><persName key="I">I</persName>t is by no means our intention in general to carry on a subject from one 
paper to another. We have our reasons for doing otherwise. But we may take 
the liberty sometimes, when the subject is of a vario<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> nature like the present; 
and when the reader may, in fact, leave off at several points, if he pleases, 
without any necessity of going forward. </note> Our author is Massuccio of Salerno, a 
novelist who disputes with Bandello the rank next in popularity to 
Boccaccio. We have not the original by <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>; and m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t be obliged to 
an English work for the ground-work of our story, as we have 
been to Paynter's Palace of Pleasure for the one j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t related. But 
we take the liberty <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual with the repeaters of these stories. We 
retain the incidents, but tell them in our own way, and imagine 
what might happen in the intervals. </p>

<p>Two <placeName key='Neapolitan'>Neapolitan</placeName> sharpers, having robbed a <placeName key='Genoese'>Genoese</placeName> merchant of 
his purse, make the best of their way to <placeName key='Sienna'>Sienna</placeName>, where they arrive 
during the preaching of <persName key="St">St</persName>. <persName key="Bernardin">Bernardin</persName>. One of them attends a sermon 
with an air of conspicuo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> modesty and devotion, and afterwards 
waits upon the preacher, and addresses him th<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>: "Reverend father, 
you see before you a man, poor indeed, but honest. <persName key="I">I</persName> do not mean 
to boast, God knows, <persName key="I">I</persName> have no reason. Who upon earth has reason 
unless it be one who will be the last to boast, like yourself, holy 
father?" Here the saintly orator shook his head, "<persName key="I">I</persName> do not mean," 
resumed the stranger, "to speak even of the reverend and ill<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>trio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> 
<persName key="Bernardin">Bernardin</persName>, but as a man among men. For my part, <persName key="I">I</persName> am, as it 
were, a creeping thing among them; and yet <persName key="I">I</persName> am honest. <persName key="I">I</persName>f <persName key="I">I</persName> 
have any virtue, it is that. <persName key="I">I</persName> crawl right onward in my path, looking 
neither to the fight nor to the left; and yet <persName key="I">I</persName> have my temptations. 
Reverend father, <persName key="I">I</persName> have found this purse. <persName key="I">I</persName> will not deny, 
that being often in want of the common necessaries of life, and 
having been obliged last night, in particular, to sit down faint at the 
city gates, for want of my ordinary cr<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t and onion, which <persName key="I">I</persName> had 
given to one (God help him!) still worse off than myself, <persName key="I">I</persName> did cast 
some looks — <persName key="I">I</persName> did, <persName key="I">I</persName> say, j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t open the purse, and cast a wistful eye 
at one of those shining pieces, that lay one over the other inside, 
with something like a wish that <persName key="I">I</persName> could procure myself a meal with 
it, unknown to the lawful proprietor. But my conscience, thank 
Heaven, prevailed. <persName key="I">I</persName> have to make two requests to you, reverend 
father. First, that you will absolve me for this my offence; and 
second, that you will be pleased to mention in one of your discourses, 
that a poor sinner from <placeName key='Milan'>Milan</placeName>, on his road to hear them, has found 
a purse, and would willingly restore it to the right owner. <persName key="I">I</persName> would 
fain give double the contents of it to find him out; but then, what 
can <persName key="I">I</persName> do? All the wealth <persName key="I">I</persName> have consists in my honesty. Be pleased, 
most ill<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>trio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> father, to mention this in your discourse, as modestly 
as becomes my nothingness; and to add especially, that the purse 
was found on the road from <placeName key='Milan'>Milan</placeName>, lying, miraculo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ly as it were, 


<pb n="87"/>

upon a sunny bank, open to the view of all, under an olive tree, not 
far from a little fountain, the pleasant noise of which peradventure 
had invited the owner to sleep." The good father, at hearing this 
detail, smiled at the anxio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> sincerity of the poor pilgrim, and giving 
him the required absolution, promised to do his utmost to bring 
forth the proprietor. <persName key="I">I</persName>n his next sermon, he accordingly dwelt with 
such eloquence on the opportunities thrown in the way of the rich 
who lose purses to behave nobly, that his congregation several 
times half rose from their seats out of enth<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>iasm, and longed for 
some convenient loss of property, that might enable them to shew 
their disinterestedness. At the concl<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ion of it, however, a man 
stepped forward, and said, that anxio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> as he was to do j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>tice to 
the finder of the purse, which he knew to be his the moment he saw it 
(only he was loth to interrupt the reverend father), he had claims upon 
him at home, in the person of his wife and thirteen children, — fourteen 
perhaps, he might now say, — which, to his great sorrow, prevented him 
from giving the finder more than a quarter of, a piece; this however 
he offered him with the less scruple, since he saw the seraphic 
disposition of the reverend preacher and his congregation, who he had no 
doubt would make ample amends for this involuntary deficiency on the 
part of a poor family man, the whole portion of whose wife and children 
might be said to be wiapt up in that purse. His sleep under the 
olive tree had been his last for these six nights (here the other man 
said, with a tremulo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> joy of acknowledgment, that it was indeed 
j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t six nights since he had found it); and heaven only knew when 
he should have had another, if his children's bread, so to speak, had 
not been found again." With these words, the sharper (for such, of 
course, he was) presented the quarter of a piece to his companion, 
who made all but a prostration for it; and hastened with the purse 
out of the church. The other man's circumstances were then 
enquired into, and as he was found to have almost as many children 
as the purse-owner, and no possessions at all, as he said, but his 
honesty, — all his children being equally poor and pio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, — a considerable 
subscription "was raised for him; so large indeed, that on the 
appearance of a new claimant next day, the pockets of the good 
people were found empty. This was no other than the <placeName key='Genoese'>Genoese</placeName> merchant, 
who having turned back on his road, when he missed his 
purse, did not stop till he came to <placeName key='Sienna'>Sienna</placeName>, and heard the news of the 
day before. <persName key="I">I</persName>magine the feelings of the deceived people. Saint

The resident canon had thought pretty nearly as much all along, but 
had held his tongue, and now hoped it would be a lesson to people 
not to listen to every body who could talk, especially to the neglect of 
Saint Antonio's monastery. As to the people themselves, they thought 
vario<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ly. Most of them were mortified at having been cheated; 
and some swore they never would be cheated again, let appearances 
be what they might. Others thought that this was a resolution 
somewhat equivocal, and more convenient than happy. For our 
parts, we think the last were right : and this reminds <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> of a true

English story, more good than striking, which we heard a short while 
ago from a friend. He knew a man of rugged manners, but good 
heart (not that the two things, as a lover of parenthesis will say, are 
at all bound to go together), who had a wife somewhat given to 
debating with hackney-coachmen, and disputing acts of settlement 
respecting half miles, and quarter miles, and abominable additional 
sixpences. The good ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ewife was lingering at the door, and 
exclaiming against one of these monstro<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> charioteers, whose hoarse 
low voice was heard at intervals, full of lying protestations and bad 
weather, when the h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>band called out from a back-room, "Never 
mind there, never mind : — let her be cheated : let her be cheated." </p>

<p>This is a digression; but it is as well to introduce it, in order 
to take away a certain bitterness out of the mouth of the other's 
moral. </p>

<p>We intended to introduce the following delightful little lyric, by a 
friend, in very different company from that of the gentlemen j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t 
presented to the reader; but as Mercury, who was the god of thieves, 
was also the inventor of the lyre, and as <persName key="Love">Love</persName> himself, time out of 
mind; has been called a thief, it is not, in all respects, 
inappropriately situated. We may fancy Mercury playing, and <persName key="Love">Love</persName> singing: —
and the song is indeed worthy of the performers. <persName key="I">I</persName>t is elemental, 
<placeName key='Platonical'>Platonical</placeName>; a meeting of divineness with humanity. </p>
