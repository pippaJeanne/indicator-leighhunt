                        <p>IT is the object of this periodical work to notice any subjects whatsoever  
within the range of the Editor's knowledge or reading. He will take them  
up, as they happen to suggest themselves; and endeavour to point out their  
essence to the reader, so as at once to be brief and satisfactory. The subjects  
will chiefly consist of curious recollections of biography; short disquisitions  
on men and things; the most interesting stories in history or fiction told  
over again, with an eye to their proper appreciation by unvulgar minds;  
and now and then a few original verses. Indeed the whole matter, whatever  
the subject may be, will be strictly original, in one sense of the word;  
arid it will be the Editor's aim, as well as a part of his own pleasure, to  
render it all as entertaining as he can. To the unvulgar he exclusively  
addresses himself; but he begs it to be particularly understood, that in this  
description of persons are to be included all those, who without having had a  
classical education, would have turned it to right account; just as all those;  
are to be excluded, who in spite of that "discipline of humanity" think  
ill of the nature which they degrade, and vulgarly confound the vulgar with  
the uneducated.</p>

    <head type="header">LUDICROUS EXAGGERATION. </head>

    <p>Men of wit sometimes like to pamper a favourite joke into exaggeration  
    — into a certain corpulence of facetiousness. Their relish  
    of the thing makes them wish it as large as possible : and the social  
    enjoyment of it is doubled by it's becoming more visible to the eyes  
    of others. It is for this reason that jests in company are sometimes  
    built up by one hand after another, — "three-piled hyperboles," — :  
    till the over-done <persName key="Babel">Babel</persName> topples and tumbles down amidst a merry  
    confusion of tongues. </p>

    <p><persName key="Falstaff">Falstaff</persName> was a great master of this art. He loved a joke as large as  
    himself; witness his famous account of the men in buckram. Thus he  
    tells the Lord Chief Justice, that he had lost his voice "with singing  
    of anthems;" and he calls <persName key="Bardolph">Bardolph</persName>'s red nose "a perpetual triumph,  
    an everlasting bonfire light" and says it has saved him "a thousand  
    marks in links and torches," walking with it "in the night betwixt  
    tavern and tavern." See how he goes heightening the account of  
    his recruits at every step : — "You would think I had a hundred and  
    fifty tattered prodigals, lately come from swine-keeping, from eating  
    draff and husks. — A mad fellow met me on the way, and told me, I  
    had unloaded all the gibbets, and pressed the dead bodies. — No eye  
    hath seen such scare-crows. — I'll not march through <placeName key='Coventry'>Coventry</placeName> with  
    them, that's flat.— <persName key="Nay">Nay</persName>, and the villains march wide betwixt the  
    legs, as if they had gyves on; for indeed I had most of them out of  
    prison.— There's but a shirt and a half in all my company; — and the  
    half-shirt is two napkins, tacked together, and thrown over the  
    shoulders like a herald's coat without sleeves." </p>

    <p>An old schoolfellow of ours, (who by the way, was more fond of  
    quoting <persName key="Falstaff">Falstaff</persName> than any other of <persName key="Shakspeare">Shakspeare</persName>'s chararacters) used to  
    be called upon for a story, <persName key="Avith">Avith</persName> a view to a joke of this sort; it  
    being an understood thing that he had a privilege of exaggeration,  
    without committing his abstract love of truth. The reader knows  

    <pb n="50"/>

    the old blunder attributed to Goldsmith about a dish of green peas.  
    Somebody had been applauded in company for advising his cook to  
    take some ill-drest peas to Hammersmith, "because that was the  
    way to turn'em Green;" upon which Goldsmith is said to have gone  
    and repeated the pun at another table in this fashion; — "John should  
    take those peas, I think, to Hammersmith." "Why so. Doctor?"  
    "Because that is the way to make 'em green." Now our friend  
    would give the blunder with this sort of additional dressing. At  
    sight of the dishes of vegetables. Goldsmith, who was at his own  
    house, took off the covers, one after another, with great anxiety, till  
    he found that peas were among them; upon which he rubbed his  
    hands with an air of infinite and prospective satisfaction. "You are  
    fond of peas. Sir?" said one of the company. "Yes, Sir," said  
    Goldsmith, "particularly so: — I eat them all the year round; — I  
    mean. Sir, every day in the season. I do not think there is any body  
    so fond of peas as I am!" "Is there any particular reason, Doctor,"  
    asked a gentleman present, "why you like peas so much, beyond the  
    usual one of their agreeable taste?" — "No, Sir, none whatsoever : —  
    none I assure you" (here Goldsmith shewed a great wish to impress  
    this fact on his guests): "I never heard any particular, encomium  
    or speech about them from any one else : but they carry their own  
    eloquence with them: they are things. Sir, of infinite taste." (Here  
    a laugh, which put Goldsmith in additional spirits.) "But, bless  
    me!" he exclaimed, looking narrowly into the peas: — "I fear they are  
    very ill-done: they are absolutely yellow instead of green" (here he  
    put a strong emphasis on green); "and you know, peas should be  
    emphatically green: — greenness in a pea is a quality as essential, as  
    whiteness in a lily. The cook has quite spoilt them : — but I'll give  
    the rogue a lecture, gentlemen, with your permission." Goldsmith  
    then rose and rang the bell violently for the cook, who came in, ready  
    booted and spurred. "Ha!" exclaimed Goldsmith, "those boots and  
    spurs are your salvation, you knave. Do you know. Sir, what you  
    have done?" — "No, Sir." — "Why, you have made the peas yellow.  
    Sir. Go instantly, and take 'em to Hammersmith." "To Hammersmith,  
    Sir?" cried the man, all in astonishment, the guests being no  
    less so : — "please Sir, why am I to take 'em to Hammersmith?" —  
    "Because, Sir," and here Goldsmith looked round with triumphant  
    anticipation, "that is the way to render those peas green." </p>

    <p>There is a very humourous piece of exaggeration in <persName key="Butler">Butler</persName>'s  
    remains,— a collection, by the bye, well worthy of <placeName key='Hudibras'>Hudibras</placeName>, and  
    indeed of more interest to the general reader. <persName key="Butler">Butler</persName> is defrauded of  
    his fame with readers of taste who happen to be no politicians, when  
    <placeName key='Hudibras'>Hudibras</placeName> is printed without this appendage. The piece we allude  
    to is a short Description of <placeName key='Holland'>Holland</placeName> : — </p>

    <lg>
    <l>A country that draws fifty foot of water,  </l>
    <l>In which men live as in the hold of nature; </l> 
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> when the sea does in upon them break, </l>
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> drowns a province, does but spring a leak. </l>

    <pb n="51"/>

    <l>That feed, like cannibals, on other fishes, </l>
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> serve their cousin-germans up in dishes. </l> 
    <l>A land that rides at anchor, and is moored. </l> 
    <l>In which they do not live, but go aboard. </l></lg>

    <p>We do not know, and perhaps it would be impossible to discover,  
    whether <persName key="Butler">Butler</persName> wrote his minor pieces before those of the great  
    patriot <persName key="And">And</persName>rew <persName key="Marvell">Marvell</persName>, who rivalled him in wit and excelled him in  
    poetry. <persName key="Marvell">Marvell</persName>, though born later, seems to have been known earlier  
    as an author. He was certainly known publicly before him. But in  
    the political poems of <persName key="Marvell">Marvell</persName> there is a ludicrous Character of  
    <placeName key='Holland'>Holland</placeName>, which might be pronounced to be either the copy or the original  
    of <persName key="Butler">Butler</persName>'s, if in those Anti-Batavian times the <placeName key='Holland'>Holland</placeName>er had  
    not been baited by all the wits; and were it not probable, that the  
    unwieldy monotony of his character gave rise to much the same  
    ludicrous imagery in many of their fancies. <persName key="Marvell">Marvell</persName>'s wit has the  
    advantage of <persName key="Butler">Butler</persName>'s, not in learning or multiplicity of contrasts (for  
    nobody ever beat him there), but in a greater variety of them, and  
    in being able, from the more poetical turn of his mind, to bring graver   
    and more imaginative things to wait upon his levity. </p>

    <p>He thus opens the battery upon our amphibious neighbour : — </p>

    <lg><l><placeName key='Holland'>Holland</placeName>, that scarce deserves the name of land, </l>
    <l>As but the off-scouring of the <placeName key='British sand'>British sand</placeName>;  </l>
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> so much earth as was contributed  </l>
    <l>By English pilots, when they heaved the lead; </l> 
    <l>Or what by the ocean's slow alluvion fell.  </l>
    <l>Of shipwrecked cockle and the muscle-shell. </l></lg>

    <lg><l>Glad then, as miners who have found the ore. </l>
    <l>They, with mad labour, <note type="hunt" place="foot"><persName key="Dryden">Dryden</persName> afterwards, of fighting for gain, in his song of "Come, if you dare:"  <q>The Gods from above the mad labour behold, </q></note> fished the land to shore; </l>
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> dived as desperately for each piece  </l>
    <l>Of earth, as if it had been of ambergreece; </l>
    <l>Collecting anxiously small loads of clay.  </l>
    <l>Less than what building swallows bear away;  </l>
    <l>Or than those pills which sordid beetles rowl. </l> 
    <l>Transfusing into them their dunghill soul. </l></lg>

    <p>He goes on in a strain of exquisite hyperbole : — </p>

    <q><l>How did they rivet with gigantic piles  </l>
    <l><placeName key='Thorough'>Thorough</placeName> the centre their new-catched miles; </l> 
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> to the stake a struggling country bound.  </l>
    <l>Where barking waves still bait the forced ground;  </l>
    <l>Building their wat'ry <persName key="Babel">Babel</persName> far more high </l>
    <l>To catch the waves, than those to scale the sky. </l> 
    <l>Yet still his claim the injured ocean layed.  </l>
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> oft at leap frog o'er their steeples played; </l>
    <l>As if on purpose it on land had come  </l>
    <l>To shew them what's their <placeName key='Mare Liberum'>Mare Liberum</placeName>; <note type="hunt" place="foot"> A Free Ocean. </note></l>
    
    <l>A dayly deluge over them does boil;  </l>

    <pb n="52"/>

    <l>The fish oft-times the burgher dispossessed.  </l>
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> sat, not as a meat, but as a guest :  </l>
    <l><persName key="And">And</persName> oft the Tritons, and the Sea-nymphs, saw  </l>
    <l>Whole shoals of Dutch served up for cabillau.  </l>
    <l>Or, as they over the new level ranged,  </l>
    <l>For pickled herring, pickled <persName key="Heeren">Heeren</persName> changed.  </l>
    <l>Nature, it seemed, ashamed of her mistake.  </l>
    <l>Would throw their land away at <placeName key='duck'>duck</placeName> and drake :  </l>
    <l>Therefore necessity, that first made kings.  </l>
    <l>Something like government among them brings:  </l>
    <l>For as with <persName key="Pigmys">Pigmys</persName>, who best kills the crane.  </l>
    <l>Among the hungry he that treasures grain.  </l>
    <l>Among the blind the one-eyed blinkard reigns. </l> 
    <l>So rules among the drowned he that drains.  </l>
    <l>Not who first sees the rising sun, commands;  </l>
    <l>But who could first discern the rising lands;  </l>
    <l>Who best could know to pump an earth so leak.  </l>
    <l>Him they their lord and country's father speak; </l> 
    <l>To make a bank was a great plot of state; —  </l>
    <l>Invent a shovel, and be a magistrate. </l></q>

    <p>We can never read these or some other ludicrous verses of <persName key="Marvell">Marvell</persName>,  
    even when by ourselves, without laughter; but we must curtail our  
    self-indulgence for the present. </p>

    <head type="header">GILBERT! GILBERT! </head>

    <p>The idea generally conveyed to us by historians of <persName key="Thomas">Thomas</persName> à <placeName key='Becket'>Becket</placeName>  
    is that of a mere haughty priest, who tried to elevate the religious  
    power above the civil. But in looking more narrowly into the accounts  
    of him, it appears that for a great part of his life he was a  
    <persName key="merry layman">merry layman</persName>, was a great falconer, feaster, and patron, as well as  
    man of business; and he wore all characters with such unaffected  
    pleasantness to all ranks, that he was called the Delight of the  
    Western World. </p>

    <p>All on a sudden, to every body's surprise, <persName key="Henry">Henry</persName> the 2nd, from  
    <persName key="Chancellor">Chancellor</persName> made him Archbishop; and with equal suddenness, though  
    retaining his affability, the new head of the English church put off  
    all his worldly graces and pleasures (save and except a rich gown  
    over his sackcloth); — and in the midst of a gay court, became the  
    most mortified of ascetics. Instead of hunting and hawking, he  
    paced a solitary cloister; instead of his wine, he drank fennel-water;  
    and in lieu of soft clothing, he indulged his back in stripes. </p>

    <p>This phenomenon has divided the opinions of the moral critics.  
    Some insist that <placeName key='Becket'>Becket</placeName> was religiously in earnest, and think the  
    change natural to a man of the world whose heart had been struck  
    with reflection. Others see in it nothing but ambition. We certainly  
    think that three parts of the truth are with the latter; and  
    that <placeName key='Becket'>Becket</placeName>, suddenly enabled to dispute a kind of sovereignty with  
    his prince and friend, gave way to the new temptation, just as he had  
    done to his falconry, and fine living. But the complete alteration of  
    his way of life — the enthusiasm which enabled him to set up so  

    <pb n="53"/>

    different a greatness against his former one, — shews, that his character  
    partook at least of as much sincerity, as would enable him to delude  
    himself in good taste. In proportion as his very egotism was  
    concerned, it was likely that such a man would exalt the gravity and  
    importance of his new calling. He had flourished at an earthly court :  
    he now wished to be as great a man in the eyes of another; and  
    worldly power, which was at once to be enjoyed and despised by virtue  
    of his religious office, had a zest given to it's possession, of which the  
    incredulousness of mere insincerity could know nothing. </p>

    <p><persName key="Thomas">Thomas</persName> à <placeName key='Becket'>Becket</placeName> may have inherited his portion of the romantic  
    from his mother, whose story is a singular one. His father, <persName key="Gilbert">Gilbert</persName>  
    <placeName key='Becket'>Becket</placeName>, who was afterwards a flourishing citizen, was in his youth  
    a soldier in the crusades; and being taken prisoner, became slave to  
    an Emir or Saracen prince. By degrees he obtained the confidence  
    of his master, and was admitted to his company, where he met a  
    personage who became more attached to him. This was the Emir's  
    daughter. Whether by her means or not does not appear; but after  
    some time he contrived to escape. The lady with her loving heart  
    followed him. She knew, they say, but two words of his language, —  
    <placeName key='London'>London</placeName> and <persName key="Gilbert">Gilbert</persName>; and by repeating the former, she obtained a  
    passage in a vessel, arrived in <placeName key='England'>England</placeName>, and found her trusting way  
    to the metropolis. She then took to her other talisman, and went  
    from street to street pronouncing <persName key="Gilbert">Gilbert</persName>. A crowd collected about  
    her wherever she went, asking of course a thousand questions, and  
    to all she had but one answer — <persName key="Gilbert">Gilbert</persName>! <persName key="Gilbert">Gilbert</persName>! She found her  
    faith in it sufficient. Chance, or her determination to go through  
    every street, brought her at last to the one, in which he who had  
    won her heart in slavery, was living in prosperous condition. The  
    crowd drew the family to the window; his servant recognized her;  
    and <persName key="Gilbert">Gilbert</persName> <placeName key='Becket'>Becket</placeName> took to his arms, and his bridal bed, his far-come  
    princess, with her solitary fond word. </p>

    <head type="header">FATAL MISTAKE OF NERVOUS DISORDERS FOR INSANITY. </head>

    <p>Some affecting catastrophes in the public papers induce us to say  
    a few words on the mistaken notions, which are so often, in our  
    opinion, the cause of their appearance. It is much to be wished  
    that some physician, truly so called, and philosophically competent  
    to the task, would write a work on this subject. We have plenty of  
    books on symptoms and other alarming matters, very useful for  
    increasing the liarm already existing. We believe also there are some  
    works of a different kind, if not written in direct counteraction; but  
    the learned authors are apt to be so prodigiously grand and etymological  
    in their title-pages, that they must frighten the general understanding  
    with their very advertisements. </p>

    <pb n="54"/>

    <p>There is this great difFeience between what is generally understood  
    by the word insanity, and the nervous or <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName> disorders, the  
    excess of which is so often confounded with it. <placeName key='Insanity'>Insanity</placeName> is a consequence  
    of malformation of the brain, and is by no means of necessity  
    attended with <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName> or even ill health. The patient, in the  
    very midst of it, is often strong, healthy, and even chearful. On the  
    other hand, nervous disorders or even <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName> in it's most aggravated  
    state, is nothing but the excess of a state of stomach and  
    blood, extremely common. The mind no doubt will act upon that  
    state, and exasperate it; but there is great reaction between mind  
    and body; and as it is a common thing for a man in an ordinary  
    fever, or fit of the bile, to be <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName>, and even to do or feel  
    inclined to do an extravagant thing, so it is as common for him to get  
    well and be quite chearful again. Thus it is among witless people  
    that the true insanity will be found. It is the more intelligent that  
    are subject to the other disorders; and a proper use of their  
    intelligence will shew them what the disorders are. </p>

    <p>But weak treatment may frighten the intelligent. A kind persbn  
    for instance, in a fit of <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName>, may confess that he feels an  
    inclination to do some desperate or even cruel thing. This is  
    often treated at once as insanity, instead of an excess of the kind  
    just mentioned; and the person seeing he is thought mad, begins to  
    think himself so, and at last acts as if he were. This is a lamentable  
    evil; but it does not stop here. The children or other relatives  
    of the person may become victims to the mistake. They think there  
    is madness, as the phrase is, "in the family;" and so whenever they  
    feel ill, or meet with a misfortune, the thought will prey upon their  
    minds; and this may lead to catastrophes, with which they have really  
    no more to do than any other sick or unfortunate people. How  
    many persons have committed an extravagance in a brain fever, or  
    undergone hallucinations of mind in consequence of getting an ague,  
    or taking opium, or fifty other causes; and yet the moment the least   
    wandering of mind is observed in them, others become frightened;  
    their fright is manifested beyond all necessity; and the patients and  
    their family must suffer for it. They seem to think, that no disorder  
    can properly be held a true Christian sickness, and fit for charitable  
    interpretation, but where the patient has gone regularly to  
    bed, and had curtains, and caudle-cups, and nurses about him,  
    like a well-behaved respectable sick gentleman. But this state of  
    things implies muscular weakness, or weakness of that sort which  
    renders the bodily action feeble. Now, in nervous disorders, the  
    muscular action may be as strong as ever; and people may reasonably  
    be allowed a world of illness, sitting in their chairs, or even  
    walking or running. </p>

    <p>These mistaken pronouncers upon disease ought to be told, that  
    when they are thus unwarrantably frightened, they are partaking of  
    the very essence of what they misapprehend; for it is fear, in all it's  
    various degrees and modifications, which is at the bottom of nervousness  
    and <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName>; not fear in it's ordinary sense, as opposed to  

    <pb n="55"/>

    cowardice, (for ainan who would shudder at a bat or a vague idea, may  
    be bold as a lion against an enemy), but imaginative fear ; — fear  
    either of something known, or of the patient knows not what; — a  
    vague sense of terror, — an impulse, — an apprehension of ill, —  
    dwelling upon some painful and worrying thought. Now this suffering  
    is inevitably connected with a weak state of the body in some  
    respects, particularly of the stomach. Hundreds will be found to  
    have felt it, if patients enquire; but the mind is sometimes afraid of  
    acknowledging it's apprehensions even to itself ; and thus fear  
    broods over and hatches fear. </p>

    <p>These disorders, generally speaking, are greater or less in their  
    effects according to the exercise of reason. But do not let the word  
    be misunderstood : we should rather say, according to the extent  
    of the information. A very imaginative man will indeed be  
    likely to suffer more than otheis; but if his knowledge is at all in  
    proportion, he will also gfet through his evil better than an  
    uninformed man suffering great terrors. <persName key="And">And</persName> the reason is, that he  
    knows how much bodily unhealthiness has to do with it. The very  
    words that frighten the unknowing, might teach them better, if  
    understood. Thus insanity itself properly means nothing but  
    unhealthiness or unsoundness. Derangement explains itself, and may surely  
    mean very harmless things. <persName key="Melancholy">Melancholy</persName> is compounded of two  
    words, which signify dark bile. <placeName key='Hypochondria'>Hypochondria</placeName> is the name of one   
    of the regions of the stomach, — a very instructive etymology. <persName key="And">And</persName>  
    lunacy refers to effects, real or imaginary, of particular states of  
    the moon; which if any thing after all, are nothing more than what  
    every delicate constitution feels in its degree from particular states  
    of the weather; for weather, like the tides, is apt to be in such and  
    such a condition, when the moon presents such and such a face. </p>

    <p>It has been said. </p>

    <p>It is curious that he who wrote the saying (<persName key="Dryden">Dryden</persName>) was a very  
    sound wit to the end of his life; while his wife, who was of a weak  
    understanding, became insane. An excellent writer (<persName key="Wordsworth">Wordsworth</persName>) has  
    written an idle couplet about the insanity of poets : </p>

    <q>We poets enter on our path with gladness,  
    But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness. </q>

    <p>If he did not mean madness in the ordinary sense, he should not  
    have written this line; if he did, he ought not to have fallen, in the  
    teeth of his information, into so vulgar an error. There are very  
    few instances of insane poets, or of insane great understandings  
    of any sort. <persName key="Bacon">Bacon</persName>, <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName>, <persName key="Newton">Newton</persName>, <persName key="Shakspeare">Shakspeare</persName>, <persName key="Cervantes">Cervantes</persName>, etc.  
    were all of minds as sound as they were great. So it has been with  
    the infinite majority of literary men of all countries. If <persName key="Tasso">Tasso</persName> and a  
    few others were exceptions, they were but exceptions; and the  
    derangement in these eminent men has very doubtful characters about  
    it, and is sometimes made a question.  It may be pretty safely

    affirmed, at least, upon an examination of it, that had they not been  
    the clever men they were, it would have been much worse and less  
    equivocal. Collins, whose case was after all one of inanition rather  
    than insanity, had been a free liver; and seems to have been hurt by  
    having a fortune left him. Cowper was weak-bodied, and beset  
    by Methodists. Swift's body was full of bad humours. He  
    himself attributed his disornered system to the effects of a surfeit of  
    fruit on his stomach; and in his last illness he used to break out in  
    enormous biles and blisters. This was a violent effort of nature to  
    help and purify the current of his blood, — the main object in all  
    such cases. Dr. Johnson, who was subject to mists of <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName>,  
    used to fancy he should go mad; but he never did. </p>

    <p><persName key="Exercise">Exercise</persName>, conversation, cheerful society, amusements of all sorts, or  
    a kind, patient, and gradual helping of the bodily health, till the mind  
    be capable of amusement (for it should never foolishly be told "not to  
    think" of <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName> things, without having something done for it  
    to mend the bodily health), — these are the cures, the only cures, and  
    in our opinion the almost infallible cures of nervous disorders,  
    however excessive. Above all, the patient shoidd be told, that there has  
    often been an end to that torment of one haunting idea, which is  
    indeed a great and venerable suffering. Many persons have got over  
    it in a week, a few weeks, or a month, some in a few months, some  
    not for years, but they have got over it at last. There is a remarkable  
    instance of this in the life of our great king <persName key="Alfred">Alfred</persName>. He was  
    seized, says his contemporary biographer, with such a strange illness,  
    while sitting at table in the twenty-fifth year (we think) of his age,  
    that he shrieked aloud; and for twenty years afterwards this illness  
    so preyed upon him, that the relief of one hour was embittered by  
    what he dreaded would come the next. His disorder is conjectured  
    by some to have been an internal cancer; by others, with more  
    probability, the black bile, or <persName key="melancholy">melancholy</persName>. The physicians of those  
    times knew nothing about it; and the people shewed at once their  
    ignorance, and their admiration of the king, by saying that the devil  
    had caused it out of jealousy. It was probably produced by anxiety  
    for the state of his country; but the same thing which wounded him  
    might have helped to keep him up; for he had plenty of business to.  
    attend to, and fought with his own hand in fifty-six pitched battles.  
    Now exactly twenty years after, in the forty-fifth year of his age (if  
    our former recollection is right) this disorder totally left him; and  
    his great heart was where it ought to be, in a heaven of health and  
    calmness. </p>
