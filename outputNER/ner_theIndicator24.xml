                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">There</hi> is not a more unthinking way of talking, than
                        to say such and such pains and pleasures are only imaginary, and therefore
                        to be got rid of or undervalued accordingly. There is nothing imaginary, in
                        the common acceptation of the word. The logic of Moses in the Vicar of
                        Wakefield is good argument here:— <cit>

                        Whatever touches us, whatever moves us, does touch and does move us. We
                        recognize the reality of it, as we do that of a hand in the dark. We might
                        as well say that a sight which makes us laugh, or a blow which brings tears
                        into our eyes, is imaginary, as that any thing else is imaginary which makes
                        us laugh or weep. We can only judge of things by their effects. Our
                        perception constantly deceives us, in things with which we suppose ourselves
                        perfectly conversant; but our reception of their effect is a different
                        matter. Whether we are materialists or immaterialists, whether things be
                        about us or within us, whether we think the sun is a substance, or only the
                        image of a divine thought, an idea, a thing imaginary, we are equally agreed
                        as to the notion of <choice>
                            <corr>its</corr>
                            <sic>it's</sic>
                        </choice> warmth. But on the
                        other hand, as this warmth is felt differently by different temperaments, so
                        what we call imaginary things affect different minds. What we have to do is
                        not to deny their effect, because we do not feel in the same proportion, or
                        whether we even feel it at all; but to see whether our neighbours may not be
                        moved. If they are, there is, to all intents and purposes, a moving cause.
                        But we do not see it? No;—neither perhaps do they. They only feel it; they
                        are only sentient,—a word which implies the sight given to the imagination
                        by the feelings. But what do you mean, we may ask in return, by seeing? Some
                        rays of light come in contact with the eye; they bring a sensation to it; in
                        a word, they touch it; and the impression left by this touch we call sight.
                        How far does this differ in effect from the impression left by any other
                        touch, however mysterious? An ox knocked down by a butcher, and a man <pb
                            n="186" /> knocked down by a fit of the apoplexy, equally feel
                        themselves compelled to drop. The tickling of a straw and of a comedy
                        equally move the muscles about our mouth. The look of a beloved eye will so
                        thrill the whole frame, that old philosophers have had recourse to a
                        doctrine of beams and radiant particles flying from one sight to another. In
                        fine, what is contact itself, and why does it affect us? There is no one
                        cause more mysterious than another, if we look into it. </p>
                    <p> Nor does the question concern us like moral causes. We may be content to
                        know the earth by <choice>
                            <corr>its</corr>
                            <sic>it's</sic>
                        </choice> fruits; but how to
                        increase and improve them is a more attractive study. If instead of saying
                        that the causes which moved in us this or that pain or pleasure were
                        imaginary, people were to say that the causes themselves were removeable,
                        they would be nearer the truth. When a stone trips us up, we do not fall to
                        disputing it's existence: we put it out of the way. In like manner, when we
                        suffer from what is called an imaginary pain, our business is not to canvass
                        the reality of it. Whether there is any cause or not in that or any other
                        perception, or whether every thing consist not in what is called effect, it
                        is sufficient for us that the effect is real. Our sole business is to remove
                        those second causes, which always accompany the original idea. As in
                        deliriums for instance, it would be idle to go about persuading the patient
                        that he did not behold the figures he says he does. He might reasonably ask
                        us, if he could, how we know any thing about the matter; or how we can be
                        sure, that in the infinite wonders of the universe, certain realities may
                        not become apparent to certain eyes, whether diseased or not. Our business
                        would be to put him into that state of health, in which human beings are not
                        diverted from their offices and comforts by a liability to such
                        imaginations. The best reply to his question would be, that such a morbidity
                        is clearly no more a fit state for a human being, than a disarranged or
                        incomplete state of works is for a watch; and that seeing the general
                        tendency of nature to this completeness or state of comfort, we naturally
                        conclude, that the imaginations in question, whether substantial or not, are
                        at least not of the same lasting or prevailing description. </p>
                    <p> We do not profess metaphysics. We are indeed so little conversant with the
                        masters of that profound art, that we are never sure whether we are using
                        even <choice>
                            <corr>its</corr>

                        </choice> proper terms. All that
                        we may know on the subject comes to us from some reflection and some
                        experience; and this all may be so little as to make a metaphysician smile;
                        which if he be a true one, he will do good-naturedly. The pretender will
                        take occasion from our very confession, to say that we know nothing. Our
                        faculty, such as it is, is rather instinctive than reasoning; rather
                        physical than metaphysical; rather wise because it loves much, than because
                        it knows much; rather calculated by a certain retention of boyhood, and by
                        it's wanderings in the green places of thought, to light upon a piece of the
                        old golden world, than to tire ourselves, and conclude it unattainable, by
                        too wide and scientific a search. We pretend to see farther than none but
                        the worldly and the malignant. <persName key="And">And</persName> yet those who see farther, may not all
                        see so well. We do not blind our eyes with looking upon the sun in the
                        heavens. We believe <pb n="187" /> it to be there, but we find it's light
                        upon earth also; and we would lead humanity, if we could, out of misery and
                        coldness into the shine of it. Pain might still be there; must be so, as
                        long as we are mortal; <cit>

                        of others, which is noble; not unnecessary pain inflicted by or upon them,
                        which it is absurd not to remove. The very pains of mankind struggle towards
                        pleasures; and such pains as are proper for them have this inevitable
                        accompaniment of true humanity,—that they cannot but realize a certain
                        gentleness of enjoyment. Thus the true bearer of pain would come round to
                        us; and he would not grudge us a share of his burden, though in taking from
                        his trouble it might diminish his pride. Pride is but a bad pleasure at the
                        expense of others. The great object of humanity is to enrich every body. If
                        it is a task destined not to succeed, it is a good one from <choice>

                            <sic>it's</sic>

                        fulfils at least a glad destiny of <choice>

                        </choice> own. To look upon it
                        austerely is in reality the reverse of austerity. It is only such an
                        impatience of the want of pleasure as leads us to grudge it in others; and
                        this impatience itself, if the sufferer knew how to use it, is but another
                        impulse, in the general yearning, towards an equal wealth of enjoyment. </p>
                    <p> But we shall be getting into other discussions.—The ground-work of all
                        happiness is health. Take care of this ground; and the doleful imaginations
                        that come to warn us against <choice>
                            <corr>its</corr>
                            <sic>it's</sic>
                        </choice> abuse, will avoid it.
                        Take care of this ground, and let as many glad imaginations throng to it as
                        possible. Read the magical works of the poets, and they will come. If you
                        doubt their existence, ask yourself whether you feel pleasure at the idea of
                        them; whether you are moved into delicious smiles, or tears as delicious. If
                        you are, the result is the same to you, whether they exist or not. It is not
                        mere words to say, that he who goes through a rich man's park, and sees
                        things in it which never bless the mental eyesight of the possessor, is
                        richer than he. He is richer. More results of pleasure come home to him. The
                        ground is actually more fertile to him: the place haunted with finer shapes.
                        He has more servants to come at his call, and administer to him with full
                        hands. Knowledge, sympathy, imagination, are all Divining Rods, with which
                        he discovers treasure. Let a painter go through the grounds, and he will see
                        not only the general colours of green and brown, but all their combination
                        and contrasts, and all the modes in which they might again be combined and
                        contrasted. He will also put figures in the landscape if there are none
                        there, flocks and herds, or a solitary spectator, or Venus lying with her
                        white body among the violets and primroses. Let a musician go through, and
                        he will hear <q>differences discreet</q> in the notes of the birds and the
                        lapsing of the water-fall. He will fancy a serenade of wind instruments in
                        the open air at the lady's window, with a voice rising through it; or the
                        horn of the hunter; or the musical cry of the hounds, <cit>

                        lover; or the chapel organ, waking up like the fountain of the winds. Let a
                        poet go through the grounds, and he will heighten and increase all these
                        sounds and images. He will bring the colours from heaven, and put an
                        unearthly meaning into the voice. He will have stories of the sylvan
                        inhabitants; will shift the population through infinite varieties; will put
                        a sentiment upon every sight and sound; will be human, romantic,
                        supernatural; will make all nature send tribute into that spot. <cit>

                        some of the Derby family at their seat at Harefield, near Uxbridge. The

<pb n="190" /> The poets are called
                        creators (<!-- rend Greek -->, Makers), because with their magical words, they bring forth to
                        our eyesight the abundant images and beauties of creation. The put them
                        there, if the reader pleases; and so are literally creators. But whether put
                        there or discovered, whether created or invented, (for invention means
                        nothing but finding out), there they are. If they touch us, they exist to as
                        much purpose as any thing else which touches us. If a passage in King Lear
                        brings the tears into our eyes, it is as real as the touch of a sorrowful
                        hand. If the flow of a song of Anacreon's intoxicates us, it is as true to a
                        pulse within us as the wine he drank. We hear not their sounds with ears,
                        nor see their sights with eyes; but we hear and see both so truly, that we
                        are moved with pleasure; and the advantage, nay, even the test, of seeing
                        and hearing, at any time, is not in the seeing and hearing, but in the ideas
                        we realize, and the pleasure we derive. Intellectual objects therefore,
                        inasmuch as they come home to us, are as true a part of the population of
                        nature, as visible ones; and they are Infinitely more abundant. Between the
                        tree of a country clown, and the tree of a <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName> or Spenser, what a
                        difference in point of productiveness! Between the plodding of a sexton
                        through a church-yard, and the walk of a Gray, what a difference! What a
                        difference between the Bermudas of a ship-builder, and the Bermoothes of
                        Shakspeare; the isle <cit>

                        and who has pleasures in solitude far richer and loftier than those of mere
