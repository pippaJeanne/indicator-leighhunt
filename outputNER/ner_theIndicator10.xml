<p>A MAN who does not contribute his quota of grim stories now-a-days, 
seems hardly to be free of the republic of letters. He is bound to wear a death's head, as part of his insignia. If he does not frighten 
every body, he is nobody. If he does not shock the ladies, what can 
be expected of him? </p>

<p>We confess we think very cheaply of these stories in general. 
A story, merely horrible or even aweful, which contains no sentiment, 
elevating to the human heart and <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> hopes, is a mere appeal to the 
least judicious, least healthy, and least masculine of our passions, fear. 
They whose attention can be gravely arrested by it, are in a fit state 
to receive any absurdity with their wits off; and this is the cause, 
why less talents are required to enforce it, than in any other species 
of composition. With this opinion of such things, we may be allowed 
to say, that we would undertake to write a dozen horrible stories in 
a day, all of which should make the common worshippers or power, 
who were not in the very healthiest condition, turn pale. We would 
tell of Haunting Old Women, and Knocking Ghosts, and Solitary 
Lean Hands, and Empusas on One Leg, and Ladies growing Longer 
and Longer, and Horrid Eyes meeting us through Key-holes, and 
Plaintive Heads, and Shrieking Statues, and Shocking Anomalies of 
Shape, and Things which when seen drove people mad; and indigestion 
knows what besides. But who would measure talents with a leg of 
veal, or a German sausage. </p>

<p>Mere grimness is as easy as grinning; but it requires something to 
put a handsome face on a story. Narratives become of suspicious 
merit in proportion as they lean to Newgate-like offences, particularly 
of blood and wounds. A child has a reasonable respect for a 
Raw-head-and-bloody-bones, because all images whatsoever of pain 
and terror are new and fearful to his inexperienced age: but 
sufferings merely physical (unless sublimated like those of <persName type="fictional" key="Philoctetes" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philoctetes">Philoctetes</persName>) 
are common-places to a grown man. Images, to become awful to him, 
flaust be removed from the grossness of the shambles. A death's head was 
a respectable thing in the hands of a poring monk, or of a nun 

<pb n="74"/>

compelled to avoid the idea of life and society, or of a hermit already 
buried in the desart, <persName key="Hans Holbein the Younger" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger" type="real">Holbein</persName>'s Dance of Death, in which every 
grinning Skeleton leads along a man of rank, from the Pope to the 
gentleman, is a good Memento Mori<note type="editorial">An object serving as a warning or reminder of death (Oxford Dictionary)</note>; but there the skeletons have 
an air of the ludicrous and satirical. If we were threatened with 
them in a grave way, as spectres, we should have a right to ask how 
they could walk about without muscles. Thus many of the tales 
written by such authors as the late <persName key="Matthew Gregory Lewis" cert="low" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthew_Gregory_Lewis" type="real">Mr. Lewis</persName>, who wanted sentiment 
to complete his talents, are quite puerile. When his spectral nuns 
go about bleeding, we think they ought in, decency to have applied 
to some ghost of a surgeon. His little Grey Men, who sit munching 
hearts, are of a piece with fellows that eat cats for a wager. </p>

<p>Stories that give mental pain to no purpose, or to very little 
purpose compared with the unpleasant ideas they excite of human nature, 
are as gross mistakes, in their way as these, and twenty times as 
pernicious: for the latter become ludicrous to grown people. They 
originate also in the same extremes, either of callousness, or morbid 
want of excitement, as the others. But more of these hereafter. 
Our business at present is with things ghastly and ghostly. </p>

<p>A ghost story, to be a good one, should unite as much as possible 
objects such as they are in life with a praeternatural spirit. And to 
be a perfect one, — at least to add to the other utility of excitement a 
moral utility,— they should imply some great sentiment, — something 
that comes out of the next world to remind us of our duties in this; 
or something that helps to carry on the idea of our humanity into 
after-life, even when we least think we shall take it with us. When

<persName type="fictional" key="Prince Hamlet" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prince_Hamlet">Hamlet</persName>, he comes armed, as he used to be, in his complete steel. 
His visor is raised; and the same fine face is there; only, in spite of 
his punishing errand and his own sufferings, with </p>

<p>When <persName key="John Donne">Donne</persName> the poet, in his thoughtful eagerness to reconcile life 
and death, had a figure of himself painted in a shroud, and laid by 
his bedside in a coffin, he did a higher thing than the monks and 
hermits with their skulls. It was taking his humanity with him into 
the other world, not affecting to lower the sense of it by regarding 
it piecemeal or in the frame-work. <persName key="Robert Burns" cert="high">Burns</persName>, in his <title level="a">Tam O'Shanter</title>, 
shews the dead in their coffins after the same fashion. He does not 
lay bare to us their skeletons or refuse, things with which we can 
connect no sympathy or spiritual wonder. They still are flesh and 
body to excite the one; yet so look and behave, inconsistent in their 
very consistency, as to excite the other. </p>

something mortal or supernatural, is always the more terrible in

is that of the beautiful woman. To return also to <title level="a" key="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner">the Ancient

<p>But we must come to <persName key="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Mr. Coleridge</persName>'s story, with all our imagination 
upon us. Now let us put our knees a little nearer the fire, 
and tell a homelier one about Life in Death. The groundwork of it 
is in <persName key="Geroge Sandys">Sandys</persName>'s Commentary upon <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>, and quoted from <persName key="Georg Sabinus">Sabinus</persName>. <note type="hunt" place="foot">The Saxon Latin poet, we presume.

We know nothing of him except from a biographical dictionary. </note>
</p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Otto">A gentleman of <placeName type="region" key="Bavaria" corresp="Germany">Bavaria</placeName></persName>, of a noble family, was so afflicted at the 
death of <persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">his wife</persName>, that unable to bear the company of any other 
person, he gave himself entirely up to a solitary way of living. This 
was the more remarkable in him, as he had been a man of jovial 
habits, fond of his wine and visitors, and impatient of having his 
numerous indulgencies contradicted. But in the same temper perhaps  
might be found the cause of his sorrow; for though he would 
be impatient with <persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">his wife</persName>, as with others, yet he loved her, as one 
of the gentlest wills he had; and the sweet and unaffected face which 
she always turned round upon his anger, might have been a thing, 
more easy for him to trespass upon, while living, than to forget, 
when dead and gone. His very anger towards her, compared with 
that toward others, was a relief to him; and rather a wish to refresh 
himself in the balmy feeling of her patience, than to make her 
unhappy herself; or to punish her, as some would have done, for 
that virtuous contrast to his own vice. </p>

<p>But whether he bethought himself, after her death, that this was 
a very selfish mode of loving; or whether, as some thought, he had 
wearied out her life with habits so contrary to her own; or whether, 
as others reported, he had put it to a fatal risque by some lordly piece 
of self-will, in consequence of which she had caught a fever on the 
cold river during a night of festivity; he surprised even those who 
thought that he loved her, by the extreme bitterness of his grief. 
The very mention of festivity, though he was patient for the first day 
or two, afterwards threw him into a passion of rage; but by degrees, 
even his rage followed his other old habits. He was gentle, but ever 
silent. He <choice><corr>ate</corr><sic>eat</sic></choice> and drank but sufficient to keep him alive; and used 
to spend the greater part of the day in the spot where his wife was 
buried. </p>

<p>He was going there one evening, in a very melancholy manner, 


<pb n="77"/>

with his eyes turned towards the earth, and had just entered the 
rails of the burial ground, when he was accosted by the mild voice of 
somebody coming to meet him. <q type="spoken">It is a blessed evening, Sir,</q> said 
the voice. <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">The gentleman</persName> looked up. Nobody but himself was 
allowed to be in the place at that hour; and yet he saw, with 
astonishment, a young chorister approaching him. He was going to 
express some wonder, when, he said, the modest though assured look 
of the boy, and the extreme beauty of his countenance, which glowed 
in the setting sun before him, made an irresistible addition to the 
singular sweetness of his voice; and he asked him with an involuntary 
calmness, and a gesture of respect, not what he did there, but what 
he wished. <q type="spoken">Only to wish you all good things,</q> answered the 
stranger, who had now come up; <q type="spoken">and to give you this letter,</q> 
<persName type="fictional" key="Otto">The gentleman</persName> took the letter, and saw upon it, with a beating yet 
scarcely bewildered heart, the handwriting of <persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">his wife</persName>. He raised his 
eyes again to speak to the boy, but he was gone. He cast them far 
and near round the place, but there were no traces of a passenger. 
He then opened the letter; and by the divine light of the setting sun, 
read these words : </p>

<p><hi rend="center">To my dear husband, who sorrows for his wife. </hi></p>

<p><persName key="Otto">Otto</persName>, my husband, the soul you regret so is returned. You will 
know the truth of this, and be prepared with calmness to see it, by 
the divineness of the messenger, who has passsd you. You will find 
me sitting in the public walk, praying for you; praying, that you 
may never more give way to those gusts of passion, and those curses 
against others, which divided us. </p>

<p>This, with a warm hand, from the living <persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">Bertha</persName>. </p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Otto">Otto</persName> (for such, it seems, was the gentleman's name) went instantly, 
calmly, quickly, yet with a sort of benumbed being, to the public 
walk. He felt, but with only a half-consciousness, as if he glided 
without a body. But all his spirit was awake, eager, intensely 
conscious. It seemed to him as if there had been but two things in the 
world, — Life and Death; and that Death was dead. All else 
appeared to have been a dream. He had awaked from a waking state, 
and found himself all eye, and spirit, and loco-motion. He said to 
himself, once, as he went : <q type="spoken">This is not a dream. I will ask my 
great ancestors tomorrow to my new bridal feast, for they are alive.</q> 
<persName type="fictional" key="Otto">Otto</persName> had been calm at first, but something of old and triumphant 
feelings seemed again to come over him. Was he again too proud 
and confident? Did his earthly humours prevail again, when he 
thought them least upon him? We shall see. </p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Otto">The Bavarian</persName> arrived at the public walk. It was full of people 
with their wives and children, enjoying the beauty of the evening. 
Something like common fear came over him, as he went in and out 
among them, looking at the benches on each side. It happened that 
there was only one person, a lady, sitting upon them. She had her 
veil down; and his being underwent a fierce but short convulsion as 

<pb n="78"/>

he went near her. Something had a little baffled the calmer inspiration 
of the angel that had accosted him; for fear prevailed at the 
instant, and <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">Otto</persName> passed on. He returned before he had reached the 
end of the walk, and approached the lady again. She was still sitting 
in the same quiet posture, only he thought she looked at him. Again 
he passed her. On his second return, a grave and sweet courage 
came upon him, and in an under but firm tone of enquiry, he said 
<q type="spoken"><persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">Bertha</persName>?</q> — <q type="spoken">I thought you had forgotten me,</q> said that well- 
known and mellow voice, which he had seemed as far from ever 
hearing again, as earth is from heaven. He took her hand, which 
grasped his in turn; and they walked home in silence together, the 
arm, which was wound within his, giving warmth for warmth. </p>

<p>The neighbours seemed to have a miraculous want of wonder at 
<persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">the lady</persName>'s reappearance. Something was said about a mock-funeral, 
and her having withdrawn from his company for awhile; but visitors 
came as before, and his wife returned to her household affairs. It 
was only remarked that she always looked pale and pensive. But she 
was more kind to all, even than before; and her pensiveness seemed 
rather the result of some great internal thought, than of unhappiness. </p>

<p>For a year or two, <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">the Bavarian</persName> retained the better temper which 
he acquired. His fortunes flourished beyond his earliest ambition; 
the most amiable as well as noble persons of the district were 
frequent visitors; and people said that to be at <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">Otto</persName>'s house, must be 
the next thing to being in heaven. But by degrees his self-will 
returned with his prosperity. He never vented impatience on his wife; 
but he again began to shew, that the disquietude it gave her to see it 
vented on others, was a secondary thing, in his mind, to the indulgence 
of it. Whether it was, that his grief for her loss had been rather 
remorse than affection, and so he held himself secure if he treated 
her well; or whether he was at all times rather proud of her, than 
fond; or whatever was the cause which again set his antipathies above 
his sympathies, certain it was, that his old habits returned upon him; 
not so often indeed; but with greater violence and pride, when they 
did. These were the only times, at which <persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">his wife</persName> was observed to 
shew any ordinary symptoms of uneasiness. </p>

<p>At length, one day, some strong rebuff which he had received from 
an alienated neighbour threw him into such a transport of rage, that 
he gave way to the most bitter imprecations, crying with a loud voice 
— <q type="spoken">This treatment to me too ! To me ! To me, who if the world 
knew all</q> ——— At these words, <persName type="fictional" key="Bertha">his wife</persName>, who had in vain laid her hand 
upon his, and looked him with dreary earnestness in the face, 
suddenly glided from the room. He, and two or three who were 
present, were struck with a dumb horror. They said, she did not walk 
out, nor vanish suddenly; but glided, as one who could dispense with 
the use of feet. After a moment's pause, the others proposed to him to 
follow her. He made a movement of despair; but they went. There 
was a short passage, which turned to the right into her favourite 
room. They knocked at the door twice or three times; and received 

<pb n="79"/>

no answer. At last; one of them gently opened it; and looking in, 
they saw her, as they thought, standing before a fire, which was the 
only light in the room. Yet she stood so far from it, as rather to be 
in the middle of the room : only the face was towards the fire, and 
she seemed looking upon it. They addressed her, but received no 
answer. They stepped gently towards her, and still received none. 
The figure stood dumb and unmoved. At last, one of them went 
round in front, and instantly fell on the floor. The figure was 
without body. A hollow hood was left instead of a face. The clothes 
were standing upright by themselves. </p>

<p>That room was blocked up for ever, for the clothes, if it might be 
so, to moulder away. It was called the Room of the Lady's Figure. 
The house, after <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">the gentleman</persName>'s death, was long uninhabited, and 
at length burnt by the peasants in an insurrection. As for himself, 
he died about nine months after, a gentle and child-like penitent. 
He had never stirred from the house since; and nobody would 
venture to go near him, but a man who had the reputation of being 
a reprobate. It was from this man that the particulars of the story 
came first. He would distribute <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">the gentleman</persName>'s alms in great 
abundance to any strange poor who would accept them; for most of 
the neighbours held them in horror. He tried all he could to get 
the parents among them to let some of their little children, or a 
single one of them, go to see <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">his employer</persName>. They said he even asked 
it one day with tears in his eyes. But they shuddered to think of it; 
and the matter was not mended, when this profane person, in a fit 
of impatience, said one day, that he would have a child of his own 
on purpose. <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">His employer</persName>, however, died in a day or two. They 
did not believe a word he told them of all <persName type="fictional" key="Otto">the Bavarian</persName>'s gentleness, 
looking upon the latter as a sort of ogre, and upon his agent as little 
better, though a goodnatured-looking earnest kind of person. It was 
said many years after, that this man had been a friend of the 
<persName type="fictional" key="Otto">Bavarian</persName>'s when young, and had been deserted by him. And the young 
believed it, whatever the old might. </p>
