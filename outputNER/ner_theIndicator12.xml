<p>We now come to a very unromantic set of rogues; the Spanish 
ones. In a poetical sense at least they are unromantic; though 
doubtless the mountains of <placeName type="country" key="Spain" corresp="Spain" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</placeName> have seen as picturesque vagabonds 
in their time, as any. There are the robbers in <title level="m" key="Gil Blas" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gil_Blas">Gil Blas</title>, who have 
at least a very respectable cavern, and loads of polite superfluities. 
Who can forget the lofty-named <persName key="Captain Rolando">Captain Rolando</persName>, with his sturdy 
height and his whiskers, shewing with a lifted torch his treasure 
to the timid stripling <persName key="Gil Blas de Santillana" type="fictional">Gil Blas</persName>? The most illustrious theft in 
Spanish story is one recorded of no less a person than the fine old 
national hero, <persName key="El Cid" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Cid" type="real" xml:id="cid">the Cid</persName>. As the sufferers were Jews, it might be 
thought that his conscience would not have hurt him in those days; 
but <q type="term">My <persName key="El Cid" ref="#cid" type="real">Cid</persName></q> was a kind of early soldier in behalf of sentiment; 
and though he went to work roughly, he meant nobly and kindly. 
<q type="spoken">God knows,</q> said he, on the present occasion, <q type="spoken">I do this thing 
more of neceasity than of wilfulness; but by God's help I shall 
redeem all.</q> The case was this. <persName key="El Cid" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Cid" type="real">The Cid</persName>, who was too good a subject 
to please his master <persName key="Alfonso VI of León and Castile" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resorce/Alfonso_VI_of_León_and_Castile" type="real">the king</persName>, had quarrelled with him, or rather 
had been banished; and nobody was to give him house-room or food. 
A number of friends however followed him; and by the help of his 
nephew <persName key="Martin Antolinez" type="fictional">Martin Antolinez</persName>, he proposed to raise some money. <persName key="Martin Antolinez" ref="#martin" type="fictional">Martin</persName> 
accordingly negociated the business with a couple of rich Jews, who 
for a deposit of two chests full of spoil, which they were not to open 
for a year, on account of political circumstances, agreed to advance 
six hundred marks. <q type="spoken">Well then, said <persName key="Martin Antolinez">Martin Antolinez</persName>, ye see that 
the night is advancing; <persName key="El Cid">the Cid</persName> is in haste, give us the marks. This 
is not the way of business, said they; we must take first, and then 
give.</q> — <persName key="Martin Antolinez">Martin</persName> accordingly goes with them to <persName key="El Cid">the Cid</persName>, who in the 
mean time has filled a couple of heavy chests with sand. <persName key="El Cid">The Cid</persName> 
smiled as they kissed his hand, and said, <q type="spoken">Ye see I am going out of 
the land because of <persName key="King Alfonso VI">the king</persName>'s displeasure; but I shall leave something 
with ye.</q> The Jews made a suitable answer, and were then 
desired to take the chests; but though strong men, they could not 
raise them from the ground. This put them in such spirits that 

<pb n="90"/>

after telling out the six hundred marks, (which <persName key="Martin Antolinez" ref="#martin" type="fictional">Don Martin</persName> took 
without weighing) they offered <persName key="El Cid">the Cid</persName> a present of a fine red skin;
and upon <persName key="Don Martin">Don Martin</persName>'s suggesting that he thought his own services 
in the business merited a pair of hose, they consulted a minute with 
each other, in order to do every thing judiciously; and then gave 
him money enough to buy, not only the hose, but a rich doublet and 
good cloak into the bargain. <note cert="high" evaluate="all" generatedBy="human" place="top" xml:space="default" type="hunt"> See <persName key="Robert Southey" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Southey" type="real">Mr. Southey</persName>'s excellent compilation entitled the <bibl><title key="Chronicle of the Cid" ref="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8491" level="m">Chronicle of the Cid</title>. <biblScope>Book 3, Sec. 21</biblScope></bibl>. If Mr. Southey — but we must recollect we are not at our 
politics. The version at the end of the book, attributed to <persName key="Mr. Hookhara Frere">Mr. Hookhara Frere</persName>, 
of a passage out of the Poema del Cid, is the most native and terse bit of 
translation we ever met with. It rides along, like  <persName key="El Cid">the Cid</persName> himself on horseback, with 
an infinite mixture of ardour and self-possessipn; bending, when it chuses, with 
grace; or bearing down every thing with mastery.</note></p>

<p>The regular sharping rogues however, that abound in Spanish 
books of adventure, have one species of romance about them, of a 
very peculiar nature. It may be called, we fear, as far as <placeName type="country" key="Spain" corresp="Spain">Spain</placeName> is 
concerned, a <q type="soCalled">romance of real life.</q> We allude to the absolute 
want and hunger, which is so often the original of their sin. A vein 
of this craving nature runs throughout most of the Spanish novels. 
In other countries, theft is generally represented as the result of an 
abuse of plenty, or some other kind of profligacy, or absolute ruin. 
But it seems to be an understood thing, that to be poor in <placeName type="country" key="Spain" corresp="Spain">Spain</placeName> is 
to be in want of the commonest necessaries of life. If a poor man 
here and there happens not to be in so destitute a state as the rest, 
he thinks himself bound to maintain the popular character for an 
appetite; and manifests the most prodigious sense of punctuality and 
anticipation in all matters relating to meals. Who ever thinks of 
<persName key="Sancho">Sancho</persName>, and does not think of ten minutes before luncheon? <persName key="Don">Don 
Quixote</persName> on the other hand counts it ungenteel and undignified to be 
hungry. The cheat, who flatters <title level="m">Gil Blas</title> reckons himself entitled 
to be insultingly triumphant, merely because he has got a dinner 
out of him. </p>

<p>Of all these ingenious children of necessity, whose roguery has 
been sharpened by perpetual want, no wit was surely ever kept at so 
subtle and fierce an edge, as that of the never-to-be-decently-treated 
<persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo de Tormes</persName>. If we had not been at a sort of monastic 
school, and known the beatitude of dry bread and a draught of 
spring-water, his history would seem to inform us, for the first 
time, what true hunger was. His cunning so truly keeps pace 
with it, that he seems recompensed for the wants of his stomach 
hy the abundant energies of his head. One half of his imagination is 
made up of dry bread and scraps, and the other of meditating how to 
get at them. Every thought of his mind, and every feeling of his 
affection, coalesces, and tends to one point, with a ventripetal force. It 
was said of a contriving lady, that she took her very tea by stratagem. 
<persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> is not so lucky. It is enough for him, if by a train of the 
most ingenious contrivances, he can lay successful siege to a crust. 
To rout some broken victuals; to circumvent an onion or so extraordinary 
is the utmost aim of his ambition. An ox-foot is his beau 

<pb n="91"/>

ideal. He has as intense and circuitous a sense of a piece of cheese, 
as a mouse at a trap. He swallows surreptitious <choice><corr>crumbs</corr><sic>crums</sic></choice> with as much 
zest, as a young servant girl does a plate of preserves. But to his 
story. He first serves a blind beggar, with whom he lives miserably, 
except when he commits thefts which subject him to miserable 
beatings. He next lives with a priest, and finds his condition worse. 
His third era of esuriency takes place in the house of a Spanish 
gentleman; and here he is worse off than ever. The reader wonders, as 
he himself did, how he can possibly ascend to this climax of starvation. 
To overreach a blind beggar, might be thought easy. The reader 
will judge by a specimen or two. The old fellow used to keep his 
mug of liquor between his legs, that <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> might not touch it 
without his knowledge. He did however; and the beggar discovering 
it, took to holding the mug in future by the handle. <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> then 
contrives to suck some of the liquor off with a reed; till the beggar 
defeats this contrivance by keeping one hand upon the vessel's mouth. 
His antagonist, upon this, makes a hole near the bottom of the mug, 
filling it up with wax, and so tapping the can with as much gentleness 
as possible, whenever his thirst makes him bold. This stratagem 
threw the blind man into despair. He <q>used to swear and domineer,</q> 
and wish both the pot and <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> contents at the devil. The following 
account of the result is a specimen of the English translation of the 
work, which is done with great tact and spirit, we know not by 
whom. But it is worthy of <persName key="Daniel Defoe">De Foe</persName>. <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> is supposed to tell 
his adventures himself. <q type="spoken">You won't accuse me any more, I hope,</q> 
cried I, <q type="spoken">of drinking your wine, <note type="hunt" place="foot">The reader is to understand a common southern wine, more like a washy 
cyder than any thing else. </note> after all the fine precautions you 
have taken to prevent it.</q> To that he said not a word; but feeling 
all about the pot, he at last unluckily discovered the hole, which 
dissembling at that time, he let me alone till next day at dinner. 
Not dreaming, my reader must know, of the old man's malicious 
stratagem, but getting in between his legs, according to my wonted 
custom, and receiving into my mouth the distilling dew, and pleasing 
myself with the success of my own ingenuity, my eyes upward, but 
half shut, the furious tyrant, taking up the sweet, but hard pot, with 
both his hands flung it down again with all his force upon my face; 
with the violence of which blow, imagining the house had fallen 
upon my head, I lay sprawling without any sentiment or judgment; 
my forehead, nose and mouth, gushing out of blood, and the latter 
full of broken teeth, and broken pieces of the can. From that time 
forward, I ever abominated the monstrous old churl, and in spite of 
all his flattering stories, could easily observe, how my punishment 
tickled the old rogue's fancy. He washed my sores with wine; and 
with a smile, <q type="spoken">What say'st thou,</q> quoth he, <q type="spoken"><persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>; the thing 
that hurt thee, now restores thee to health. Courage, my boy."
But all his raillery could not make me change my mind.</q> </p>

<p>At another time, a countryman giving them a cluster of grapes, 
the old man, says <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>, <q type="spoken">would needs take that opportunity to 

<pb n="92"/>

shew me a little kindness, after he had been chiding and beating me 
the whole day before.</q> So setting ourselves down by a hedge,
<q type="spoken">Come hither, <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>,</q> quoth he, <q type="spoken">and let us enjoy ourselves a 
little, and eat these raisins together; which that we may share like 
brothers, do you take but one at a time, and be sure not to cheat me, 
and I promise you for my part, I shall take no move.</q> That I 
readily agreed to, and so we began our banquet; but at the very 
second time he took a couple, believing, I suppose, that I would do 
the same. And finding he had shewed me the way, I made no 
scruple all the while to take two, three, or four at a time; sometimes 
more and sometimes less, as conveniently I could. When we had 
done, the old man shook his head, and holding the stalk in his hand, 
<q type="spoken">Thou hast cheated me, <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>,</q> quoth he, <q type="spoken">for I could take my 
oath, that thou hast taken three at a time.</q> <q type="spoken">Who I! I beg your 
pardon,</q> quoth I, <q type="spoken">my conscience is as dear to me as another.</q> 
<q type="spoken">Pass that jest upon another,</q> answered the old fox; <q type="spoken">you saw me 
take two at a time without complaining of it, and therefore you took 
three.</q> At that I could hardly forbear laughing; and at the same 
time admired- the justness of his reasoning." <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> at length 
quitted the service of the old hard-hearted miser, and revenged 
himself upon him at the same time, in a very summary manner. They 
were returning home one day on account of bad weather, when they 
had to cross a kennel which the rain had swelled to a little torrent. 
The beggar was about to jump over it as well as he could, when 
<persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> persuaded him to go a little lower down the stream, because 
there was a better crossing; that is, there was a stone pillar on the 
other side, against which he knew the blind old fellow would 
nearly dash his brains out. "He was mightily pleased with my advice, 
<q type="spoken">Thou art in the right on it, good boy,</q> quoth he, <q type="spoken">and I love 
thee with all my heart, <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>. Lead me to the place thou 
speakest of; the water is very dangerous in winter, and especially to 
have one's feet wet.</q> And again : — <q type="spoken">Be sure to set me in the right 
place, <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>,</q> quoth he; <q type="spoken">and then do thou go over first.</q> I 
obeyed his orders, and set him exactly before the pillar, and so 
leaping over, posted myself behind it, looking upon him as a man would 
do upon a mad bull. <q type="spoken">Now your jump,</q> quoth I, <q type="spoken">and you may 
get over to rights, without ever touching the water.</q> I had scarce 
done speaking, when the old man, like a ram that's fighting, ran 
three steps backwards, to take his start with the greater vigour, and 
so his head came with a vengeance against the stone-pillar, which 
made him fall back into the kennel half dead." <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> stops a 
moment to triumph over him with insulting language; and then, 
says he, <q type="spoken">resigning my blind, bruised, wet, old, cross, cunning 
master, to the care of the mob that was gathered about him, I made 
the best of my heels, without ever looking about, till I had got the 
town-gate upon my back; and thence, marching on a merry pace, I 
arrived before night at Torrigo.</q> </p>

<p>At the house of the priest, poor <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> gets worse off than 
before, and is obliged to resort to the most extraordinary shifts to 
arrive at a morsel of bread. At one time, he gets a key of a tinker 

<pb n="93"/>

and opening the old trunk in which the miser kept his bread, (a 
sight, he says, like the opening of heaven) he takes small pieces out 
of three or four, in imitation of a mouse; which so convinces the old 
hunks that the mice and rats have been at them, that he is more 
liberal of the bread than usual. He lets him have in particular <q type="written">the 
parings about the parts where he thought the mice had been.</q> 
Another of his contrivances is to palm off his pickings upon a serpent, 
with which animal a neighbour told the priest that his house had 
been once haunted. <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>, who had been used when he lived 
with the beggar to husband pieces of money in his mouth, (substituting 
some lesser coin in the blind man's hand, when people gave 
him any thing) now employs the same hiding-place for his key; but 
whistling through it unfortunately, one night, as he lay breathing 
hard in his sleep, the priest concludes he has now caught the serpent, 
and going to <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>'s bed with a broomstick, gives him at a venture 
such a tremendous blow on the head, as half murders him". The key 
is then discovered, and the poor fellow turned out of doors. </p>

<p>He is now hired by a lofty-looking hidalgo; and follows him home, 
eating a thousand good things by anticipation. They pass through 
the markets however to no purpose. The squire first goes to church 
too, and spends an unconscionable time at mass. At length they 
arrive at a dreary, ominous looking house, and ascend into a decent 
apartment, where the squire after shaking his cloak, and blowing off 
the dust from a stone seat, lays it neatly down, and so makes a 
cushion of it to sit upon. There is no other furniture in the room, 
nor even in the neighbouring rooms, except a bed <q>composed of the 
anatomy of an old hamper.</q> The truth is, the squire is as poor as 
<persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>, only too proud to own it; and so he starves both himself 
and his servant at home, and then issues gallantly forth of a morning, 
with his <placeName type="city" key="Toledo" corresp="Spain">Toledo</placeName> by his side, and a countenance of stately satisfaction , 
returning home every day about noon with <q>a starched body, 
reaching out his neck like a grey-hound.</q> <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> had not been a 
day in the house, before he found out how matters went. He was 
beginning, in his despair of a dinner, to eat some scraps of bread 
which had been given him in the morning, when the squire observing 
him, asked what he was about. <q type="spoken">Come hither, boy,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">what's 
that thou art eating?</q> <q type="spoken">I went,</q> says <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>, <q type="spoken">and shewed him 
three pieces of bread, of which taking away the best, "upon my 
faith,</q> quoth he, <q type="spoken">this bread seems to be very good.</q> <q type="spoken">Tis too 
stale and hard. Sir,</q> said I, <q type="spoken">to be good.</q> <q type="spoken">I swear 'tis very 
good,</q> said the squire ; <q type="spoken">Who gave it thee? Were their hands 
clean that gave it thee?</q> <q type="spoken">I took it without asking any questions. 
Sir,</q> answered I, <q type="spoken">and you see I eat it as freely.</q> <q type="spoken">Pray God it 
may be so,</q> answered the miserable squire; and so putting the 
bread to his mouth, he eat it with no less appetite than I did mine; 
adding at every mouthful, <q type="spoken">Gadzooks, this bread is excellent.</q> </p>

<p><persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName> in short here finds the bare table so completely turned 
upon him, that he is forced to become provider for his master as well 
as himself; which he does by fairly going out every day and begging, 
the poor squire winking at the indignity, though not without a hint 

<pb n="94"/>

at keeping the connexion secret. The following extract shall be our 
climax, which it may well be, the hunger having thus ascended into 
the ribs of Spanish aristocracy. <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>, one lucky day, has an 
ox-foot and some tripe given him by a butcher-woman. On coming 
home with his treasure, he finds the hidalgo impatiently walking up 
and down, and feais he shall have a scolding for staying so long: but 
the squire merely asks where he has been, and receives the account 
with an irrepressible air of delight. <q type="spoken">I sate down,</q> says <persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>, 
"upon the end of the stone seat, and began to eat that he might 
fency I was feasting; and observed without seeming to take notice, 
that his eye was fixed upon my skirt, which was all the plate and 
table that I had. </p>

<p>"May God pity me as I had compassion on that poor squire; daily 
experience made me sensible of his trouble. I did not know whether 
I should invite him, for since he had told me he had dined, I 
thought he would make a point of honour to refuse to eat; but in 
short, being very desirous to supply his necessity, as I had done the 
day before, and which I was then much better in a condition to do, 
having already sufficiently stuffed my own guts : it was not long 
before an opportunity fairly offered itself; for he taking occasion to 
come near me in his walks, <q type="spoken"><persName key="Lazarillo de Tormes">Lazarillo</persName>,</q> quoth he, (as soon as he 
observed me begin to eat) <q type="spoken">I never saw any body eat so handsomely 
as thee; a body can scarce see thee fall to work without desiring to 
bear thee company: let their stomachs be never so full, or their 
mouth be never so much out of taste.</q> Faith, thought I to myself, 
with such an empty belly as yours, my own mouth would water at 
a great deal less. </p>

<p>"But finding he was come where I wished him. <q type="spoken">Sir,</q> said I, 
<q type="spoken">good stuff makes a good workman. This is admirable bread, and 
here's an ox-foot so nicely drest and so well seasoned, that any body 
would delight to taste of it.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">How!</q> cried the squire, interrupting me, <q type="spoken">an ox- foot?</q> <q type="spoken">Yes, 
Sir,</q> said I, <q type="spoken">an ox-foot.</q> <q type="spoken">Ah ! <hi rend="italic">then</hi>,</q> quoth he, <q type="spoken"><hi rend="italic">thou hast in 
my opinion the delicatest bit in <placeName type="country" key="Spain" corresp="Spain">Spain</placeName></hi>; there being neither partridge, 
pheasant, nor any other thing that I like nearly so well as that.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Will you please to try. Sir,</q> said I, (putting the ox-foot in his 
hand, with two good morcels of bread) <q type="spoken">when you have tasted it, 
you will be convinced that it is a treat for a king, 'tis so well drest 
and seasoned.</q> </p>

<p>"Upon that, sitting down by my side, he began to eat, or rather 
to devour what I had given him, so that the bones could hardly 
escape. <q type="spoken">Oh! the excellent bit,</q> did he cry, <q type="spoken">that this would be 
with a little <choice><orig>garlick</orig><reg>garlic</reg></choice>.</q> Ha ! thought I to myself, how hastily thou 
eatest it without sauce. <q type="spoken">Gad,</q> said the squire, <q type="spoken">I have eaten, 
this as heartily as if I had not tasted a bit of victuals to day;</q> which 
I did very readily believe. </p>

<p>"He then called for the pitcher with the water, which was as 
full as I had brought it home; so you may guess whether he had eat 
any. When his squireship had drank, he civilly invited me to do the 
like; and thus ended our feast." </p>

<p>We hope the reader is as much amused with this prolongation of 
the subject as ourselves, for we are led on insensibly by these amusing 
thieves, and find we shall have yet another paper to write upon them, 
before we have done. We will therefore conclude the present one 
by giving another specimen or two of the sharping Spaniard out of 
<persName key="Francisco de Quevedo">Quevedo</persName>. The Adventures, by the way, of <persName key="Lazrillo de Torres">Lazarillo de Tormes</persName> 
were written in the sixteenth century by a Spanish gentleman, 
apparently of illustrious family, <persName key="Don Diego de Mendoza">Don Diego de Mendoza</persName>, who was 
sometime ambassador at <placeName type="city" key="Venice" corresp="Italy">Venice</placeName>. This renders the story of the hidalgo 
still more curious. Not that the author perhaps ever felt the proud 
but condescending pangs which he describes; this is not necessary 
for a man of imagination. He merely meant to give a hint to the 
poorer gentry not to overdo the matter on the side of loftiness, for 
their own sakes; and hunger, whether among the proud or the 
humble, was too national a thing, not to be entered into by his 
statistic apprehension. </p>

<p>The most popular work connected with sharping adventures in 
<title level="m">Gil Blas</title> which though known to us as a French production, seems 
unquestionably to have originated in the country where the scene is 
laid. It is a work exquisitely easy and true; but somehow we have 
no fancy for the knaves in it. They are of too smooth, sneaking, 
and safe a cast. They neither bespeak one's sympathy by necessity, 
nor one's admiration by daring. We except, of course, the robbers 
before-mentioned, who are a picturesque patch in the work, like a 
piece of rough poetry. </p>

<p>Of the illustrious <persName type="fictional" key="Guzman d'Alfarache">Guzman d'Alfarache</persName>, the most popular book of 
the kind, we believe, in <placeName type="country" key="Spain" corresp="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and admired, we know, in this 
country by some excellent judges, we cannot with propriety speak, 
for we have only read a few pages at the beginning; though we read 
those twice over, at two different times, and each time with the same 
intention of going on. In truth, as <persName key="Guzman d'Alfarache">Guzman</persName> is called by way of 
eminence the Spanish Rogue, we must say for him, as far as our 
slight acquaintance warrants it, that he is also <q type="soCalled">as tedious as a king.</q> 
They say however he has excellent stuff in him. </p>

<p>We can speak as little of <persName key="Marcos de Obregon">Marcos de Obregon</persName>, of which a translation 
appeared a little while ago. We have read it; and if we 
remember rightly, were pleased; but want of memory on these occasions 
is not a good symptom. <persName key="Francisco de Quevedo">Quevedo</persName>, no ordinary person, is very 
amusing. His Visions of Hell in particular, though of a very different 
kind from <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName>'s, are more edifying. But our business at present 
is with his <title level="m">"History of <persName type="fictional" key="Don Pablo">Paul the Spanish Sharper</persName>, the Pattern of 
Rogues and Mirror of Vagabonds."</title> We do not know that he deserves 
these appellations so much as some others; but they are to be looked 
upon as titular ornaments, common to the Spanish Kleptocracy. He 
is extremely pleasant, especially in his younger days. <persName type="fictional" key="Aldonza Saturno de Rebollo">His mother</persName>, 
who is no better than the progenitor of such a personage ought to 
be, happens to have the misfortune one day of being carted. <persName type="fictional" key="Don Pablo">Paul</persName>, 
who was then school-boy, was elected king on some boyish holiday 
and riding out upon a half-starved horse, it picked up a small cabbage, 
as they went through the market. The market-women began pelting 
the king with rotten oranges, and turnip-tops; upon which

having feathers in his cap, and getting a notion in his head that they 
mistook him for <persName type="fictional" key="Aldonza Saturno de Rebello">his mother</persName>, who agreeably to a Spanish custom was 
tricked out in the same manner when she was carted, he halloed out, 
<q type="spoken">Good women, though I wear feathers in my cap, I am none of 
<persName type="fictional" key="Aldonza Saturno de Rebollo">Alonza Saturno de Rebillo</persName>. She is <persName type="fictional" key="Aldonza Saturno de Rebollo">my mother</persName>.</q> </p>

<p><persName key="Don Pablo">Paul</persName> used to be set upon unlucky tricks by the son of a man of 
rank, who preferred enjoying a joke to getting punished for it. 
Among others, one Christmas, a counselloi- happening to go by of the 
nanle of <persName key="Pontio de Auguirre">Pontio de Auguirre</persName>, the little <persName key="Don Diego">Don</persName> told his companion to 
call Pontius Pilate, and then to run away. He did so, and the angry 
counsellor followed after him with a knife in his hand, so that he 
was forced to take refuge in the house of the schoohnaster. The 
lawyer laid his indictment, and <persName key="Don Pablo">Paul</persName> got a hearty flogging, during 
which he was enjoined never to call <persName key="Pontius">Pontius Pilate</persName> again; to which 
he heartily agreed. The consequence was, that next day, when 
the boys were at prayers, <persName key="Don Pablo">Paul</persName>, coming to the belief, and thinking 
that he was never again to name Pontius Pilate, gravely said,  
<q type="spoken">Suffered under <persName key="Pontio de Auguirre">Pontio de Auguirre</persName>;</q> which evidence of his horror of 
the scourge so interested the pedagogue, that by a Catholic mode of 
dispensation, he absolved hira from the next two whippings he should 
incur. </p>

<p>But we forget, that <persName key="Don Pablo">our little picaro</persName> was a thief. One specimen 
of his talents this way, and we have done with the Spaniards. He 
went with young <persName key="Don Diego">Don Diego</persName> to the university : and here getting 
applause for some tricks he played people, and dandling, as it were, 
his growing propensity to theft, he invited his companions one evening 
to see him steal a box of comfits from a confectioner's. He 
according draws his rapier, which was stiff and well pointed; runs 
violently into the shop; and exclaiming <q type="spoken">You're a dead man,</q> 
makes a fierce lunge at the confectioner between the body and arm. 
Down drops the man, half dead with fear: the others rush out. 
But what of the box of comfits? <q type="spoken">Where are the box of comfits, 
<persName key="Don Pablo">Paul</persName>?</q> said the rogues: <q type="spoken">we do not see what you have done after 
all, except frighten the fellow.</q> <q type="spoken">Look here, my boys,</q> answered 
<persName key="Don Pablo">Paul</persName>. They looked, and at the end of his rapier beheld, with shouts 
of laughter, the vanquished box. He had marked it out on the 
shelf; and under pretense; of lunging at the confectioner, pinked it 
away like a muffin. </p>

<p>Upon turning to <persName key="Francisco de Quevedo">Quevedo</persName>, we find that the story has grown a little 
upon our memory, as to detail; but this is the spirit of it. The 
prize here, it is to be observed, is something eatable; and the same 
yearning is a predominant property of <persName key="Francisco de Quevedo">Quevedo</persName>'s sharpers, as well as 
the others. </p>

<p>Adieu, ye pleasant rogues of <placeName type="country" key="Spain" corresp="Spain">Spain</placeName>! ye surmounters of bad 
government, hunger, and misery, by the mere force of a light climate 
and fingers! The dinner calls;— and to talk about you before it, is 
as good as taking a ride on horseback. </p>
