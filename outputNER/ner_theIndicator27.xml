daughter of <persName type="fictional" key="Pandion (mythology)" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pandion_(mythology)" xml:id="Pandion">Pandion</persName>, king of <placeName type="city" key="Athens" corresp="Greece" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1524">Athens</placeName>. They bound each other by a
vow never to love any one else. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, who was fond of hunting,
suffered the wood-nymphs to be charming to no purpose; and <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>,
waiting his return every day from the <choice><corr>chase</corr><sic>chace</sic></choice>, scarcely had a civil answer
for the most agreeable of the Wood-Gods. </p>

<p>Their security in each others exclusive attachment was increased, if
possible, by a passion which was conceived for <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> by <persName key="Aurora" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Aurora_(mythology)" type="fictional" xml:id="Aurora">Aurora</persName>,
the Goddess of Morning. To think that the beaming eyes and rosy
blushes of so charming a deity were upon him every morning to no
purpose, was a high exaltation to the proud confidence which each
reposed in the other. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, whom the very particular vow which
they had entered into had begun to render a little too apt to be jealous,
concluded that if he could deny a goddess, she need have no fear of
the nymphs. All that disturbed her was lest <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName> should grow
angry. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, on the other hand, whatever airs he might occasionally
give himself on the strength of his fidelity, held it to be
utterly impossible, that <persName type="fictional" key="Procris" ref="#Procris">his wife</persName> should for a moment forget the
rejecter of a divinity. </p>
<p><persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName> however was not angry. She was too much in love. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>
began to feel a softer pride when he found that she still loved him
secretly, and that she did all in her power to gratify him. The dawns
in <placeName type="region" key="Thessaly" corresp="Greece">Thessaly</placeName> had never been known to be so fine. Rosy little clouds,
floating in yellow light, were sure to usher in the day, whatever it
might turn out at noon. He had but to wish for more air, and it came
streaming upon his face. Did he want light in a gloomy depth of the
forest? Beams thrilled through the twisted thickets, and made the
hunters start to see their faces so plainly. Some said, that a divine
countenance was to be seen at these times, passing on the other side of
the trees, and looking through. It is certain, that when <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> had
lain down towards noon to rest himself in a solitary place, he would
see, as he woke, a nymph suddenly departing from the spot, whose
hair shook out a kind of sunshine, He knew that this was <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName>,
and could not help being touched by so delicate an aflection. </p>

<pb n="210"/>

<p>By degrees, <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> began to think that <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> might spare a little
of so great a love; and as these wicked thoughts stole upon him, he
found <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName> steal nearer. She came closer to him, as he pretended
to sleep; and loitered more in going away. At length they conversed
again; and the argument, which was uppermost in both their minds,
soon got more and more explicit. We are bound to believe that a
goddess could reason more divinely on the subject; but it must not
be concealed, that the argument which made the greatest impression
on <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, was one, which has since been much in fashion, though
we cannot say a great deal for it. All defences of love should proceed
upon the kindest grounds, or on none. The moment it refers to
anything like retaliation, or even to a justice which hazards such
feelings, it is trenching on the monstrous territory of hate. Be this
however as it may, <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName>, one morning, did certainly condescend to
finish a conversation with saying, that she would not look to have her
love returned, unless <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> should first be found unfaithful. </p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus" ref="#Cephalus">The husband</persName>, in whose mind this suggestion seemed to awaken all
his exclusive tenderness for <persName type="fictional" key="Procris" ref="#Procris">his wife</persName>, readily accepted the alternative.
But how was <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> to be tried? <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName> soon found an expedient.
She changed the appearance of <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> to that of a young Phoenician
merchant; filled his pockets with gold and jewels; hung the rarest
gems from <placeName type="region" key="Ormus" corresp="Hurmuz Island" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2478280">Ormus<note type="editorial"> Ormus/ Hormuz is an island within the Persian gulf, now possessed by Portugal. The Kingdom of Ormus was established in the 11th century and extended along the eastern side of the Persian Gulf.</note></placeName> and the <placeName type="physical" key="Red Sea" corresp="Red Sea" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23406">Red Sea</placeName> in his turban; and seating him in
a Sidonian ear, drawn by white fawns, with a peacock standing beside
him on the edge, sent him to offer all these bribes to <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> for her
love. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> turned a little pale at sight of the fawns; but his
colour and even his gaiety returned in a minute; and taking a respectful
farewell of <persName key="Aurora" ref="#Aurora" type="fictional">the Goddess</persName>, he shook the reins, and set off down the
grassy valley that led to his home. </p>

<p>The fawns, with a yearning yet easy swiftness, wound along down
the sides of the hill. Their snowy figures flashed in and out of the
trees; the peacock's tail trailed along the air; the jewels sparkled in
the stranger's turban. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, looking out of the window for <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus" ref="#Cephalus">her
husband</persName>, wondered what illustrious unknown was coming. He is
evidently coming towards her abode. It is the only one in the valley.
He arrives, and making a respectful obeisance, alights and enters. He
makes no request for admittance, but yet no fault is to be found with
his easy gravity. He says indeed that he could not but come in,
whether he would or no, for the fame of <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>'s beauty and sweetness
had reached him in <placeName type="region" key="Phoenicia" corresp="Lebanon" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41642">Phoenicia</placeName>; and as his father's great riches
allowed him to travel at his leisure, he had brought a few trifles,—
not as a return for the few hours' hospitality which he should presume
upon;—by no means;—but solely as he had not wit or attraction
enough of his own, to leave any other memorial of his visit and homage.
All this was somewhat too elaborate for the people in those days; but
<persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, in his confidence, had become a little over-ingenious; and
when he had done speaking, and had presented his splendid credentials,
<persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> thought that the accomplished stranger undervalued himself.
A little obstacle presented itself. On giving her the peacock, the
handsome stranger stooped his face with an air of confident but respectful
pleasure, and was about to kiss her. <q type="spoken">How is this?</q> said

<pb n="211"/>

<persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>. <q type="spoken">We always do so in <placeName type="region" key="Phoenicia" corresp="Lebanon">Phoenicia</placeName>,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">when presents
are received;</q> and without more ado, he kissed her in a sort of formal
and cabalistic manner, first on one cheek, then on the other, and
lastly on the forehead. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> submitted, purely because she did
not know how to object to a Phoenician custom. But on his presenting
a casket full of gold, she demurred. He seemed to take no notice
of this, but stooped as before, and kissed her, not only on the cheeks
and forehead, but on the lips. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> blushed, and looked displeased.
<q type="spoken">We always do so in <placeName type="region" key="Phoenecia" corresp="Lebanon">Phoenecia</placeName>;</q> said he, in a tone, as if all offence
must be done away by that explanation. Another casket succeeded,
full of jewels, and much more precious than the last. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> wondered
whether any additional ceremony was to take place in return,
and was about to decline the third present in some alarm, when the
stranger, with as brief an indifference of voice as his gallantry could
assume, observed, that all that was to be done for the third gift, was to
have the kiss returned,—slightly, it was true; but still returned:—it
was always the way in <placeName type="region" key="Phoenicia" corresp="Lebanon">Phoenicia</placeName>. And he had scarcely spoken the
word when he stooped as before, and kissed her. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> would sincerely
have objected to returning the salute; but as she said afterwards,
she really had not time to consider. Besides, she persuaded
herself that she felt relieved at thinking the casket was to be the last
present; and so,—giving a short glance at the window,—the kiss was
returned. A very odd, and not comfortable expression passed over
the face of the stranger, but very quickly. The only reason that
<persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> could conceive why he should look so, was, that the salute
might have been too slight. <q type="thought">He is very generous, I own,</q> thought,
she; <q type="thought">but these Phoenicians are strange people.</q> The stranger had
now a totally different air. It was that of an excessive gaiety, in
which respect was nevertheless strongly mingled. <q type="spoken">Having honoured
me so far with your acquaintance,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">nothing remains but to
close our Phoenician ceremonies of introduction with this trifle from
the <placeName type="physical" key="Red Sea" corresp="Red Sea">Red Sea</placeName>.</q> So saying, he took a most magnificent ruby from the
front of his turban, and hitched it on the collar of her vest. <q type="spoken">The
hook,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">is of Phoenician <choice><corr>crystal</corr><sic>chrystal</sic></choice>.</q> <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>'s ears fairly
tingled with the word Phoenician. She was bewildered; the ceremonies
were indeed about to close; and this word somewhat relieved
her; but she was going to demur in a more peremptory manner, when
he said that all that was to be done on this final occasion was just to
embrace him—slightly—in a sisterly way;—<q type="spoken">It is not always done,</q>
said he:—<q type="spoken">the Tyre people, for instance, do not do it; but the Sidonians
do; and generally speaking, it is the closing custom in Phoenici—</q>—and
the final syllable was lost in a new kiss, against which
she found it out of her power to remonstrate. In giving her at the
same time a brief but affectionate embrace, he contrived to bring her
arms about himself. He then bowed in the most respectful and grateful
manner imaginable, and handed her to a seat. </p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, with whom the ice had been thus broken, and who already
thought herself half faithless to the strictness of her vow, scarcely
knew whether to feel more angry at the warmth, or piqued at the
ceremonious indifference, of the stranger. A sense however of gratified 

<pb n="212"/>

pride, and of his extraordinary generosity, was the uppermost
feeling in her mind; and this led her to be piqued rather than angry.
Luckily, she bethought herself of offering him the hospitality of the
house, which helped to divert her confusion. The milk and fruit
were brought out; and he tasted them, more, it seemed, out of politeness,
than for want of refreshment. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> cast her eyes, first up
the hill, and then at the fawns. She wondered whether the fawns and
car would follow the other presents; but upon the whole concluded
they would not, unless the traveller meant to stop, which was impossible;
at least in that house. She made up her mind therefore to be
very angry in case he should offer the fawns; when he interrupted
any farther reflections. <q type="spoken">Those fawns,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">came into my
possession in a remarkable manner. They are fatal.</q> <q type="spoken">Fatal?</q>
echoed <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>. <q type="spoken">Not in a bad sense,</q> returned the stranger, smiling:
<q type="spoken">I am destined to present them to some fair one, (I know not
who she is), who shall honour me with the privileges of a husband,
and who is to be fairer than the Goddess that gave them me.</q> <q type="spoken">A
strange impossible condition,</q> said <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>; <q type="spoken">but who, pray was the
Goddess?</q>—<q type="spoken"><persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName>.</q>—The beautiful wife of <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> smiled victoriously
at the mention of that name. She had already triumphed
over the divinity, and thought that this new test of superiority was
scarcely necessary. The Phoenician, upon seeing her turn of countenance,
added significantly; <q type="spoken">I saw her just now, and must confess
that it will take something very extraordinary to surpass her; but I
do not conceive it actually impossible.</q> <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> longed to tell him of
<persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName>'s unsuccessful passion for <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>. She asked how long it
was, since he had seen <persName key="Aurora">the Goddess</persName>. <q type="spoken">I saw her but now,</q> said the
stranger: <q type="spoken">she was conversing in the forest here.</q> <q type="spoken">Do you know
with whom?</q> asked <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, <q type="spoken">Oh yes; it was <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus" ref="#Cephalus">your husband</persName>: and
this reminds me, that he told me to beg you not to be alarmed, but
he should not return till night-fall.</q> <q type="spoken">Not till night-fall?</q> half
murmured and half enquired <persName type="fictional" key="Procris" ref="#Procris">the fair conqueror of <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName></persName>.—Now this
was wrong in <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>. He was led into the mention of his interview
with <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName> by <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> being actually the case; but he need not have
gone so far with the lesson she had taught him. We blush to say that
it succeeded but too well. There is no necessity to pursue the detail
farther. Towards night-fall <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> gave anxious looks up the hill,
and hoped (which was kind of her) that <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">her husband</persName> might receive
great pleasure from the present she intended to make him of the
fawns. <q type="spoken">I think he is coming down the hill,</q> said she. <q type="spoken">No,</q> said
the stranger. <q type="spoken">How can you tell,</q> returned <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, <q type="spoken">with your
face turned from the window?</q> <q type="spoken">Look at me,</q> replied he, <q type="spoken">and
you will know.</q> <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> turned quickly, and looked him in the face.
It was <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> himself. Astonishment, fear, shame, and a sense of
the triumphant artifice of <persName key="Aurora">the Goddess</persName>, fell upon her at once. She
uttered a loud shriek; and tearing her vest from <persName key="Cephalus">her husband</persName>'s grasp,
darted off into the woods. </p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, in his chariot of fawns, sought her a hundred ways in
vain. He was at once angry and sorry: and <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName> found that her
artifice had been of no use. She hoped however that time, and the

<pb n="213"/>

absence of <persName type="fictional" key="Procris" ref="#Procris">his wife</persName>, would mollify him; and in the mean while, seeing
how sullenly he turned aside whenever she ventured to become manifest,
she tried to humble him a little. His skill became less supereminent
in the <choice><corr>chase</corr><sic>chace</sic></choice>. Other dogs ran faster than his; and other
lances took truer aim. The gloom of the forest was still enlightened
for him, because she did not wish to let him know how she was trying
him; but the name of <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> suffered in <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> reputation. People
began to say that <persName type="fictional" key="Phalerus" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phalerus">Phalerus</persName> was as good as he. </p>

<p>He was sitting at home one evening in a melancholy manner, after
an unsuccessful day's sport, when a beautiful female with a dog appeared
at the door, and begged permission to rest herself. The faintness
of her voice interested our suffering huntsman. He brought her
in with great kindness, set refreshments before her, and could not help
gazing with admiration on her lovely face, which covered with blushes,
looked with a particularly melancholy expression on the fruits and
the bowls of cream. He thought he distressed her, and began playing
in a negligent manner with the dog. The animal, at a slight snap of
his fingers, darted up on his legs like lightning, and stood panting
and looking eagerly towards the door. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> had the finest dogs
in <placeName type="region" key="Thessaly" corresp="Greece">Thessaly</placeName>, yet he doubted whether this was not finer than any of
them. He looked at the female, and now saw that she was buskined
up like a nymph of the <choice><corr>chase</corr><sic>chace</sic></choice>. <q type="thought">The truth flashes upon me,</q> thought
he; <q type="thought">this is a fugitive nymph of <persName key="Diana (mythology)" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diana_(mythology)" type="fictional" xml:id="Diana">Diana</persName>. Her buskins and her blushes
tell her whole story.</q> The fair stranger seemed first oppressed, and
then relieved by his gaze. <q type="spoken">You guess,</q> said she, <q type="spoken">but too well, I
fear, what has put me upon your kind hospitality. But the other
sex, especially where they are of the best natures, will be too kind to
betray me. I have indeed fled from the company of <persName key="Diana">Diana</persName>, having
been first left myself by a River-God, who</q>—She blushed, and was
silent. <q type="spoken">And this dog?</q> enquired <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, after reassuring her.
<q type="spoken">It was my favourite dog in the <choice><corr>chase</corr><sic>chace</sic></choice>,</q> said she; <q type="spoken">now my faithful
companion in flight. Poor Lailaps!</q> And the dog, forgetting his
vivacity in an instant, came and lay at his mistress's feet, as if he
would have wound about them. They were very beautiful feet.
<q type="thought">The River-God doubtless admired them,</q> thought <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>. But
there was a something in her face more touching than all the shapeliness
in the world. It was a mixture of the pensive and the pleasurable,
which seemed to say that if she had no cause for trouble, she would
have been all tender vivacity. <q type="spoken">And whither are you going, fairest?</q>
asked <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>. <q type="spoken">To <placeName type="country" key="Cyprus" corresp="Cyprus" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q229">Cyprus</placeName>.</q>—<q type="spoken">To the temple of <persName key="Venus (mythology)" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venus_(mythology)" type="fictional">Venus</persName>?</q>—
<q type="spoken">To the temple of <persName key="Venus">Venus</persName>:</q> replied the beautiful stranger, dropping
her words and face as she spoke. <q type="spoken">I have made a new vow, which—
a new vow.</q> And blushing more deeply, she was again silent.—
<q type="thought">Which she shall be able to keep better then the last,</q> thought <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>.
She sat in a simple posture, her back gently bending, her
knees together, her rosy face and languid eyes looking down sideways
between her dark heavy curls. She moved the fingers of her right hand
towards the dog, as if snapping them; but it was done faintly, and evidently
only to do something. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> thought she had a look of
<persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>; and he did not pity her the less for that. <q type="spoken">But what

<pb n="214"/>

are you to do with this dog?</q> This, it seemed, was a very perplexing
question. It was a long time before <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> could get an answer;
but he was so kind and importunate, and really, with all his love of
hunting, appeared to be so much more interested in the nymph than
her companion, that at length he did obtain a sort of understanding
on the subject. It was necessary to make a renouncement of something
highly valued by the possessor, before a new devotee could enter
on the service of <persName key="Venus">Venus</persName>. The renouncement was to be made to one
of the other sex; and <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, partly out of curiosity, partly out of
vanity, partly out of self-interest, and not a little out of an interest
of a better sort, contrived to discover, that it would be made, with
no prodigious unwillingness, to himself. <q type="spoken">Lailaps,</q> said he. The
dog started towards him, as if he knew his future master. The lady
gave a gentle laugh, and seemed much happier. The supper, that
evening, was upon a much easier footing than the luncheon. The
next morning, on waking, <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, saw the face of <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> hanging
over him. He would have been more astonished had he not remembered
his own transformation. But he was nevertheless quite enough
so. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> shook her head at him archly; then kissed him kindly;
then burst into tears; then declared herself happy and forgiving, as
well as forgiven; and neither of them ever passed a happier day in
their lives. </p>
<p><persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>'s account of herself was partly true. Our informant<note type="hunt">

not account for a proceeding which certainly requires some explanation;
but she had really gone to the haunts of <persName key="Diana">Diana</persName>, whose reception
of her, though a huntress, was what might have been expected.
She begged her, in very explicit terms, to withdraw. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>,
however, though she could obtain no sympathy purely on her
own account, contrived to waken an interest in the bosom of <persName key="Diana" ref="#Diana" type="fictional">the
divine virgin</persName> by telling her of the trick played by <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> and <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName>.
This she thought abominable. She therefore wrought a counter-change
in the appearance of <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>; and giving her a hound out
of her own pack, sent her to practise artifice for artifice. She regretted
afterwards the having consented to interfere at all in such
matters; but the impulse had engaged her to commit herself; and she
was too proud and stately to recall what she had done. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> told
all to <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus" ref="#Cephalus">her husband</persName>; and <persName key="Aurora" cert="medium" ref="#Aurora" type="fictional">the goddess</persName> was little aware how they enjoyed
the kind result of her anger, at the expense of her dignity. </p>

<p>It is on record, that our married couple were never so fond of each
other, or so contented, as now. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, in the gratitude of her joy,
was not disposed even to quarrel with <persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName>, whom her husband no
doubt saw occasionally. But it is not known whether he was kinder
to her than before. <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> was inclined to think not, as he said
nothing about it; so certain she had become of his confidence. As
to <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>, the praises of <persName type="fictional" key="Procris" ref="#Procris">his wife</persName> by his fellow-huntsmen gave
him great pleasure, now that he was sure of her loving him unrestrictedly. </p>

<p>What a pity that such a happy state of things was not to last! But
<persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> had early been taught jealousy. She had even identified it

<pb n="215"/>

with a virtue; and by degrees, as little fits of ill temper were exchanged,
and she began to think less kindly of herself, she began to
be uneasy about others. Unfortunately for this return of her complaint,
a little anxious busy-body, whom she had been accustomed to
treat with contemptuous indifference, perhaps to <choice><corr>show</corr><sic>shew</sic></choice> it too much,
came and said to her one day, that as she knew she should not be
mortifying her with such petty matters, she might tell her, as a piece
of news, that <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> was passionately and notoriously in love with
a beautiful nymph of the name of Aura. <q type="spoken"><persName key="Aurora">Aurora</persName>, you mean,</q>
said <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, scornfully. <q type="spoken">No, no,</q> said the little snappish voice;
<q type="spoken">Aura, Aura:—I know it well enough; all <placeName type="city" key="Athens" corresp="Greece">Athens</placeName> knows it, or
else I should not have repeated it. I am no tale-bearer; but I hate
to see a man pretending to be what he is not.</q> <q type="spoken"><persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> pretends
nothing,</q> said <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>. <q type="spoken">Oh—of course,</q> said the gossip; <q type="spoken">and
mighty useful it is to him no doubt, to be so wanting in pretence.
But my maxim is, Be decent enough, at least, to appear virtuous.</q>
<q type="thought">Yes,</q> thought <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, <q type="thought">and your whole life would be an exemplification
of it, if you could hold your tongue.</q> But the blow was
struck. She despised the scandal, while she became <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> victim. </p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName>, who was on a visit with <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> to <persName key="Pandion" ref="#Pandion" type="fictional">her father</persName>, had heard of a
spot, in which he reposed himself every day after the <choice><corr>chase</corr><sic>chace</sic></choice>. Here, it was
added, the lady as regularly met him. He was even so impatient for
her sight, that if she delayed a minute beyond the usual time, he
called upon her aloud, in the fondest manner. <q type="spoken">Come, come, sweet
Aura,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">and cool this glow in my bosom.</q></p>

<p>Now his delight in the new spot, and the invocation also, were both
very true; only the informant forget to mention, and <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> to remember,
that although Aura was the name of a female, it also signified
the fresh air. </p>
<p>One day, <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> went as usual into his favourite haunt, to enjoy
<choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> freshness, verdure, and seclusion. The place has been very prettily
described by <persName key="Ovid" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ovid" type="real">Ovid</persName>. </p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> lay upon a slope of the velvet ground, his hands behind
his head, and his face towards the balmy heaven. He little thought
that <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> was near. She was lurking close to him behind some box-trees.
She listened. There was not a sound, but that of the fountain,
the noise of whose splashes was softened by the trees that half encircled
it. She listened again, thinking she heard <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">her husband</persName> speak. It was
only the fervid bees, buzzing along from <placeName type="physical" key="Hymettus" corresp="Greece">Hymettus</placeName>, and murmuring as
if disdainfully in her ear. A variety of feelings agitate her. Now she
is sorry that she came, and would have given any thing to be back
again. Now she longs to know who her rival is. Now she is sorry
again, and feels that her conduct is unworthy, let <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">her husband</persName>'s be
what it may. Now she reassures herself, and thinks, that he should
have at least been ingenuous. Jealousy and curiosity prevail, and she
still looks and listens. The air seems more then usually quiet; and
the bees worry her with their officious humming. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName> leaps up,
and plays idly with his javelin. Still nothing is said. Nobody appears.
She expects the lady every minute to issue from the trees; and thinks
how she shall confound her. But no one comes. At last, <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">her husband</persName>
speaks. She parts the box-trees a little more, to listen the keener.
<q type="spoken">Come, gentle <persName key="Aura">Aura</persName>,</q> cried he, as if in a tone of reproach—<q type="spoken">Come,
and breathe refreshment upon me:—thou scarcely stirrest the poplars

He thinks it a deer hampered in the thicket, and raises his javelin to
dart it. Forbear, forbear, <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">miserable man</persName>: it is thy more <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">miserable
wife</persName>! Alas! the javelin is thrown, and <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">the wife</persName> pierced. Upon
coming up to secure his prey, he finds, with a dumb despair, that it
is <persName type="fictional" key="Procris">Procris</persName> dying. She does not reproach him. She reproaches only
herself. <q type="spoken">Forgive me,</q> said she, <q type="spoken">dear <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>,</q> pressing her
cheek against his: <q type="spoken">I was made wise in vain once, and I am now wise
again too late. Forgive my poor jealous heart, and bless me. It weeps
blood for <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> folly.</q> And as she spoke, she sobbed aloud; and the penitent
tears gushed away, as if to emulate the gushing of her heart. <persName type="fictional" key="Cephalus">Cephalus</persName>,
bewildered and agonized, uttered what kind and remorseful words
his lips could frame, pressing her all the while gently to his heart. He saw
that the wound was mortal, and it was quickly so. Her eyes faded away
while looking at him; but opening her lips, she still made a yearning
movement of them towards his. It reminded him of paying that affectionate
office to the departing spirit; and, stooping with a face washed
in tears, he put his mouth upon her's, and received at once her last
kiss and breath.
