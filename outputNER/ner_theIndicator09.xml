<head type="header">MORE NEWS OF ULYSSES. </head>

<p>Talking the other day with a friend about <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName>, he observed, 
that whenever so great a poet told us any thing in addition or 
continuation of an ancient story, he had a right to be regarded as classical 
authority. For instance, said he, when he tells us of that characteristic 
death of Ulysses in one of the books of his Inferno, we ought 
to receive the information as authentic, and be glad that we have 
more news of Ulysses than we looked for. </p>

<p>We thought this a happy remark, and instantly turned with him 
to the passage in question; for not having read <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName> regularly, we 
had passed it over so slightly as not to remember it. Yet it is 
a striking one, as the reader will see. The last account of Ulysses 
upon which we may fairly reckon, in the ancient poets, is his sudden 
re-appearance before the suitors at <placeName key='Ithaca'>Ithaca</placeName>, and his consummate and 
godlike victory over their crest-fallen insolence. There is something 
more told of him, it is true, before the Odyssey concludes; but with 
the exception of his visit to his aged father, our memory scarcely 
wishes to retain it; nor does it controvert the general impression 
left upon us, that the wandering hero is victorious over his domestic 
enemies; and reposes at last, and for life, in the bosom of his family. </p>

<p>The lesser poets however could not let him alone. <persName key="Homer">Homer</persName> leaves 
the general impression upon one's mind, as to the close of his life;
but there are plenty of obscurer fables about it still. We have 
specimens in modern times of this propensity never to have done with a 
good story; which is natural enough, though not very wise; nor 
are the best writers likely to meddle with it. Thus <persName key="Cervantes">Cervantes</persName> was 
plagued with a spurious Quixote; and our circulating libraries have 
the adventures of <persName key="Tom Jones">Tom Jones</persName> in his Married State. The ancient 
writers on the present subject, availing themselves of an obscure 
prophecy of <persName key="Tiresias">Tiresias</persName>, who tells Ulysses on his visit to hell, that 
his old enemy the sea would be the death of him at last, bring 
over the sea <persName key="Telegonus">Telegonus</persName>, his son by the goddess <persName key="Circe">Circe</persName>, who gets into 
a scuffle with the <placeName key='Ithaca'>Ithaca</placeName>ns, and kills his father unknowingly. It is 
added, that <persName key="Telegonus">Telegonus</persName> afterwards returned to his mother's island, 
taking <persName key="Penelope">Penelope</persName> and his half-brother <persName key="Telemachus">Telemachus</persName> with him; and 

<pb n="66"/>

here a singular arrangement takes place, more after the fashion of 
a modern Catholic dynasty, than an ancient heathen one: for while 
<choice><orig>AEdipus</orig><reg>Oedipus</reg></choice> was fated to undergo such dreadful misfortunes for marrying 
his mother without the knowledge of either party, Minerva herself 
comes down from heaven, on the present occasion, to order <persName key="Telegonus">Telegonus</persName> 
the son of Ulysses, to marry his father's wife; the other son, 
at the same time, making a suitable match with his father's mistress, 
<persName key="Circe">Circe</persName>, <persName key="Telemachus">Telemachus</persName> seems to have had the best of this extraordinary 
bargain, for <persName key="Circe">Circe</persName> was a goddess, consequently always young; and 
yet to perplex these windings-up still more, <persName key="Telemachus">Telemachus</persName> is represented 
by some as marrying <persName key="Circe">Circe</persName>'s daughter, and killing his immortal 
mother-in-law. Nor does the character of the chaste and enduring 
<persName key="Penelope">Penelope</persName> escape in the confusion. Instead of waiting her husband's 
return in that patient manner, she is reported to have been 
over-hospitable to all the suitors; the consequence of which was a son 
called Pan, being no less a personage than the god Pan himself, or 
Nature; a fiction, as Lord Bacon says, "applied very absurdly and 
indiscreetly." There are different stories respecting her lovers; but it is 
reported that when Ulysses returned from Troy, he divorced her for 
incontinence; and that she fled, and passed her latter days in 
Mantinea. Some even go so far as to say, that her father Icarius had 
attempted to destroy her when young, because the oracle had told him 
that she would be the most dissolute of the family. This was probably 
invented by the comic writers out of a buffoon malignity; for 
there are men, so foolishly incredulous with regard to principle, that 
the reputation of it, even in a fiction, makes them impatient. </p>

<p>Now it is impossible to say whether <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName> would have left Ulysses 
quietly with <persName key="Penelope">Penelope</persName> after all his sufferings, had he known them 
as described in <persName key="Homer">Homer</persName>. The old Florentine, though wilful enough 
when he wanted to dispose of a modern's fate, had great veneration 
for his ancient predecessors. <persName key="At">At</persName> all events, he was not acquainted 
with <persName key="Homer">Homer</persName>'s works. They did not make their way again into <placeName key='Italy'>Italy</placeName> 
till a little later. But there were Latin writers extant, who might 
have informed him of the other stories relative to Ulysses; and he 
saw nothing in them, to hinder him from giving the great wanderer 
a death of his own. </p>

<p>He has accordingly, with great attention to nature, made him 
impatient of staying at home, after a life of such adventure and 
excitement. But we will relate the story in his own order. He begins 
it with one of his most romantic pieces of wildness. The poet and 
his guide <persName key="Virgil">Virgil</persName> are making the best of their difiicult path along a 
ridge of the craggy rock, that overhangs the eighth gulph of hell: 
when <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName>, looking down, sees the abyss before him full of flickering 
lights; as numerous, he says, as the fire-flies, which a peasant, 
reposing on a hill, sees filling the valley, of a hot evening. Every 
flame shot about separately; and he knew that some terrible mystery 
or other accompanied it. As he leaned down from the rock, grasping 
one of the crags, in order to look closer, his guide who perceived his 
earnestness, said, "Within those fires are spirits; every one swathed 

<pb n="67"/>

in what is burning him." <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName> told him, that he had already 
guessed as much; and pointing to one of them in particular, asked 
who was in that fire, which was divided at top, as though it had  
ascended from the funeral-pile of the hating Theban brothers. 
"Within that," answered <persName key="Virgil">Virgil</persName>, "are Diomed and Ulysses; who 
speed together now to their own misery, as they used to do to that of 
others." They were suffering the penalty of the various frauds they 
had perpetrated in concert; such as the contrivance of the Trojan 
horse, and the plunder of the Palladium. <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName> entreats with the 
greatest earnestness, that if those who are within the sparkling horror 
can speak, it may be made to come near. <persName key="Virgil">Virgil</persName> says it shall; but 
begs the Florentine not to question it himself; as the spirits, being 
Greek, might be shy of holding discourse with him. When the flame 
has come near enough to be spoken to, <persName key="Virgil">Virgil</persName> addresses the "two 
within one fire;" and requests them, if he ever deserved anything of 
them as a poet, great or little, that they would not go away, till one 
of them had told him how he came into that extremity. </p>

<p><persName key="At">At</persName> this, says <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName>, the greater horn of the old fire began to lap 
hither and thither, murmuring; like a flame struggling with the 
wind. The top then, yearning to and fro, like a tongue trying to 
speak, threw out a voice, and said : "When I departed from <persName key="Circe">Circe</persName>, 
who withdrew me to her for more than a year in the neighbourhood 
of <persName key="Gaieta">Gaieta</persName>, before <persName key="Eneas">Eneas</persName> had so named it; neither the sweet company 
of my son, nor pious affection for my old father, nor the long-owed 
love with which I ought to have gladdened <persName key="Penelope">Penelope</persName>, could conquer 
the ardour that was in me to become wise in knowledge of the world, 
of man's vices and his virtue. I put forth into the great open deep 
with only one bark, and the small remaining crew by whom I had 
not been left. I saw the two shores on either side, as far as <placeName key='Spain'>Spain</placeName>  
and <placeName key='Morocco'>Morocco</placeName>; and the island of <placeName key='Sardinia'>Sardinia</placeName>, and the other isles which 
the sea there bathes round about. Slowly we went, my companions and 
I, for we were old; till at last we came to that narrow outlet, where 
<persName key="Hercules">Hercules</persName> set up his pillars, that no man might go further. I left <placeName key='Seville'>Seville</placeName> 
on the right hand : on the other I had left <placeName key='Ceuta'>Ceuta</placeName>. O brothers, said 
I, who through a hundred thousand perils are at length arrived at 
the west, deny not to the short waking day that yet remains to our 
senses, an insight into the unpeopled world, setting your backs upon 
the sun. Consider the stock from which ye sprang : ye were not 
made to live like the brute beasts, but to follow virtue and 
knowledge. I so sharpened my companions with this little speech on our 
way, that it would have been difficult for me to have withheld them, 
if I would. We left the morning right in our stern, and made wings 
of our oars for the idle flight, always gaining upon the left. The 
night now beheld all the stars of the other pole; while our own was 
so low, that it arose not out of the ocean-floor. Five times the light 
had risen underneath the moon, and five, times fallen, since we put 
forth upon the great deep; when we descried a dim mountain in the 
distance, which appeared higher to me than ever I had seen any before. 
We rejoiced, and as soon mourned : for there sprung a whirlwind 

<pb n="68"/>

from the new land; and struck the foremost frame of our vessel. 
Three times, with all the waters, it whirled us round : at the fourth 
it dashed the stern up in air, and the prow downwards; till, as 
seemed fit to others, the ocean closed above our heads." </p>

<p>Why poor Ulysses should find himself in hell after his immersion, 
and be condemned to a swathing of eternal fire, while <persName key="St. Dominic">St. Dominic</persName>, 
who deluged <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>ianity with fire and blood, is called a <placeName key='Cherubic'>Cherubic</placeName> 
light, the papist, not the poet, must explain. He puts all the Pagans 
in hell, because however good some of them may have been, they 
lived before <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>, and could not worship God properly â€” (debitamente). 
But he laments their state, and represents them as suffering 
a mitigated punishment: they only live in a state of perpetual 
desire without hope <hi xml:lang="italian">(sol di tanto offesi)</hi> ! A sufficing misery, it must 
be allowed; but compared with the horrors he fancies for heretics 
and others, undoubtedly a great relief. <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName>, throughout his 
extraordinary work, gives many evidences of great natural sensibility;
and his countenance, as handed down to us, as well as the shadestruck 
gravity of his poetry in general, shews the cuts and disquietudes 
of heart he must have endured. But unless the occasional 
hell of his own troubles, and his consciousness or the mutability of all 
things, helped him to discover the brevity of individual suffering as a 
particular, and the lastingness of nature's benevolence as an universal; 
and thus gave his poem an intention beyond what appears upon 
the surface; we must conclude, that a bigoted education, and the 
fierce party politics in which he was a leader and a sufferer, obscured 
the kind greatness of his spirit. It is always to be recollected 
forever, as Mr. Coleridge has observed somewhere in other words, that 
when men consign each other to eternal punishment and such like 
horrors, their belief is rather a venting of present impatience and  
dislike, than any thing which they take it for. The fiercest Papist or 
Calvinist only flatters himself (a strange flattery too ! ) that he could 
behold a fellow creature tumbling and shrieking about in eternal fire. 
He would begin shrieking himself in a few minutes; and think that 
he and all heaven ought to pass away, rather than that one such 
agony should continue. Tertullian himself, when he longed to 
behold the enemies of his faith burning and liquefying, only meant, 
without knowing it, that he was in an excessive rage at not convincing 
every body that read him. Yet, in the mean time, these notions 
disturb humanity, and degrade the Divine Spirit. </p>

<head type="header">FAR COUNTRIES.</head>


<p>Imagination, though no mean thing, is not a proud one. If it 
looks down from its wings upon common places, it only the more 
perceives the vastness of the region about it. The infinity into 

<pb n="69"/>

which it's flight carries it, might indeed throw back upon it a too 
great sense of insignificance, did not Beanty or Moral Justice, 
with it's equal eye, look through that blank aspect of power, and 
reassure it; shewing it, that there is a power as much above power 
itself, as the thought that reaches to all, is to the hand that can 
touch only thus far. </p>

<p>But we do not wish to get into this tempting region of speculation, 
just now. We only intend to shew a particular instance, in which 
imagination instinctively displays it's natural humility : we mean, in 
the fondness which imaginative times and people have shewn for 
what is personally remote from them; for what is opposed to their 
own individual consciousness, even in range of space, in farness of 
situation. </p>

<p>There is no surer mark of a vain people than their treating other 
nations with contempt, especially those of whom they know least. 
It is better to verify the proverb, and take every thing unknown for 
magnificent, rather than predetermine it to be worthless. The gain 
is greater. The instinct is more judicious. When we mention the 
French as an instance, we do not mean to be invidious. Most nations 
have their good as well as bad features; and in Vanity Fair there are 
many booths. </p>

<p>The French, not long ago, praised one of their neighbours so 
highly, that the latter is suspected to have lost as much modesty, as 
the former gained by it. But they did this as a set-off against their 
own despots and bigots. When they again became the greatest 
power in <placeName key='Europe'>Europe</placeName>, they had a relapse of their old egotism. The 
French, though an amiable and intelligent people, are not an imaginative 
one. The greatest height they go is in a balloon. They get 
no farther than <placeName key='France'>France</placeName>, let them go where they will. They "run 
the great circle and are still at home," like the squirrel in his rolling 
cage. Instead of going to Nature in their poetry, they would make 
her come to them, and dress herself at their last new <choice><orig>toilet</orig><reg>toilette</reg></choice>. In 
practical philosophy and metaphysics, they divest themselves of gross 
prejudices, and then think they are in as graceful a state of nakedness 
as Adam and Eve. </p>

<p><persName key="At">At</persName> the time when the French had this fit upon them of praising 
the English (which was nevertheless the honester one of the two), 
they took to praising the Chinese for numberless unknown qualities. 
This seems a contradiction to the near-sightedness we speak of : but 
the reason they praised them was, that the Chinese had the merit of 
unbounded religious toleration; a great and extraordinary one 
certainly, and not the less so, for having been, to all appearance, the 
work of one man. All the romance of <placeName key='China'>China</placeName>, such as it was, â€” any 
thing in which they differed from the French, â€” their dress, their 
porcelain towers, their Great Wall, â€” was nothing. It was the 
particular agreement with the philosophers. </p>

<p>It happened curiously enough, that they could not have selected 
for their panegyric a nation apparently more contemptuous of others; 
or at least more self-satisfied and unimaginative. The Chinese are 
cunning and ingenious; and have a great talent at bowing out 

<pb n="70"/>

ambassadors who come to visit them. But it is somewhat inconsistent 
with what appears to be their general character, that they should 
pay strangers even this equivocal compliment; for under a prodigious 
mask of politeness, they are not slow to evince their contempt 
of other nations, whenever any comparison is insinuated with the 
subjects of the Brother of the Sun and Moon. The knowledge they 
respect in us most, is that of gun-making, and of the East <placeName key='India'>India</placeName>n 
passage. When our countrymen shewed them a map of the earth, they 
enquired for <placeName key='China'>China</placeName>; and on finding that it only made a little piece 
in a corner, could not contain their derision. They thought that it 
was the main territory in the middle, the apple of the world's eye. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the most imaginative nations, in their highest 
times, have had a respect for remote countries. It is a mistake to 
suppose that the ancient term barbarian, applied to foreigners, 
suggested the meaning we are apt to give it. It may have gathered 
some such insolence with it among the Romans, as they spread their 
own barbarous power; but the more intellectual Greeks venerated 
the countries from which they brought the elements of their mythology 
and philosophy. The philosopher travelled into <placeName key='Egypt'>Egypt</placeName>, like a 
son to see his father. The merchant heard in <placeName key='Phoenicia'>Phoenicia</placeName> the far- 
brought stories of other realms, which he told to his delighted 
countrymen. It is supposed, that the mortal pari; of <persName key="Mentor">Mentor</persName> in the 
Odyssey was drawn from one of these voyagers. When Anacharsis 
the Scythian was reproached with his native place by an unworthy 
Greek, he said, "My country may be a shame to me, but you are a 
shame to your country." <placeName key='Greece'>Greece</placeName> had a lofty notion of the Persians 
and the <placeName key='Great King'>Great King</placeName>, till <persName key="Xerxes">Xerxes</persName> came over to teach it better, and 
betrayed the softness of their skulls. </p>

<p>It was the same with the <persName key="Arabian">Arabian</persName>s, at the time when they had the 
chief accomplishments of the world to themselves; as we see by their 
delightful tales. Every thing shines with them in the distance, like 
a sunset. What an amiable people are their Persians! What a 
wonderful place is the island of <placeName key='Serendib'>Serendib</placeName>! You would think nothing 
could be finer than the <placeName key='Caliph'>Caliph</placeName>'s city of <placeName key='Bagdat'>Bagdat</placeName>, till you hear of Grand 
Cairo; and how has that epithet and that name towered in the 
imagination of all those, who have not had the misfortune to see the 
modern city! <placeName key='Sindbad'>Sindbad</placeName> was respected, like Ulysses, because he had 
seen so many adventures and nations. So was Aboulfaouris the 
Great Voyager, in the Persian Tales. His very name sounds like a 
wonder. </p>

<p>One of the main helps to our love of remoteness in general, is the 
associations we connect with it of peace and quietness. Whatever 
there may be at a distance, people feel as if they should escape 
from the worry of their local cares. "O that I had wings like 
a dove! then would I fly away and be at rest." The word far is 
often used wilfully in poetry, to render distance still more distant.

<p>In childhood, the total ignorance of the world, especially when we 
are brought up in some confined spot, renders every thing beyond 
the bounds of our dwelling a distance and a romance. Mr. Lamb, in 
his Recollections of <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>'s Hospital, says that he remembers when some 
half-dozen of his schoolfellows set off, "without map, card, or 
compass, on a serious expedition to find out <persName key="Philip Quarll">Philip Quarll</persName>'s Island." We 
once encountered a set of boys as romantic. It was at no greater 
distance than at the foot of a hill near <placeName key='Hampstead'>Hampstead</placeName>; yet the spot was 
so perfectly <placeName key='Cisalpine'>Cisalpine</placeName> to them, that two of them came up to us with 
looks of hushing eagerness, and asked, "whether, on the other side 
of that hill there were not robbers:" to which, the minor 
adventurer of the two added, "<persName key="And">And</persName> some say, serpents." They had 
all got bows and arrows, and were evidently hovering about the 
place, betwixt daring and apprehension, as on the borders of some 
wild region. We smiled to think which it was that husbanded their 
suburb wonders to more, advantage, they or we : for while they peopled 
the place with robbers and serpents, we were peopling it with 
sylvans and fairies. </p>

<head type="header">PASSAGES FROM OSSIAN, ALLUDED TO IN OUR LAST. </head>

<p>On renewing our acquaintance with <persName key="Ossian">Ossian</persName>, we felt tempted to 
go to some length about him; but we must reserve our criticism for 
another time. The following are as many specimens of his uses of 
mist, as we have room for. The first is very grand; the second as 
happy in it's analogy; the third is ghastly, but of more doubtful 
merit. </p>

<p>TWO CHIEFS PARTED BY THEIR KING.â€”<cit><quote>"They sunk from the king on either 
side, like two columns of morning mist, when the sun rises between them on his 
glittering rocks. Dark is their rolling on either side, each toward its reedy pool." </quote><note type="source"><bibl><persName key="Macpherson">Macpherson</persName>, <persName key="James">James</persName>: Temora (Book 4)</bibl></note></cit></p>

<p>A GREAT ENEMY.â€”<cit><quote>"I love a foe like <persName key="Cathmor">Cathmor</persName>: his soul is great; his arm is 
strong; his battles are full of fame. But the little soul is like a vapour, that 
hovers round the marshy lake. It never rises on the green hill, lest the winds 
meet it there." </quote><note type="source"><bibl><persName key="Macpherson">Macpherson</persName>, <persName key="James">James</persName>: Temora</bibl></note> </cit></p>

<p>A TERRIBLE OMEN.â€”<cit><quote>"A mist rose slowly from the lake. It came, in the 
figure of an aged man, along the silent plain. It's large limbs did not move in 
steps; for a ghost supported it in mid air. It came towards <persName key="Selma">Selma</persName>'s hall, and 
dissolved in a shower of blood."</quote><note type="source"><bibl><persName key="Macpherson">Macpherson</persName>, <persName key="James">James</persName>: <persName key="Carthon">Carthon</persName>: A Poem</bibl></note></cit></p>
