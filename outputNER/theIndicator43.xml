<p>
In laying before our readers an account of another new publication, 
it is fortunate that the nature of the work again falls in with the character of our miscellany; part of the object of which is to relate the stories of old times. We shall therefore abridge into prose the stories 
which <persName key="John Keats" type="real" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/John_Keats">Mr. Keats</persName> has told in poetry, only making up for it, as we go, by cutting some of the richest passages out of his verse, and fitting them 
in to our plainer narrative. They are such as would leaven a much 
greater lump. Their drops are rich and vital, the essence of a heap 
of fertile thoughts.</p> 

<p>The first story, entitled Lamia, was suggested to our author by a 
passage in <persName type="real" key="Robert Burton" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/Robert_Burton">Burton</persName>'s <title key="Anatomy of Melancholy" level="m" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/The_Anatomy_of_Melancholy">Anatomy of Melancholy</title>, which he has extracted 
at the end of it. We will extract it here, at the beginning, that the 
readers may see how he has enriched it. <persName type="real" key="Robert Burton" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/Robert_Burton">Burton</persName>'s relation is itself an improvement on the account in <persName type="real" key="Lucius Flavius Philostratus">Philostratus</persName>. The old book-fighter with melancholy thoughts is speaking of the seductions of phantasmata.</p>

play, and dtink such wine as never any drank, and no man should 
molest him; but she, being fair and lovely, would live and die with 
him, that was fair and lovely to behold. The young man, a philosopher, otherwise staid and discreet, able to moderate his passions, though not this of love, tarried with her awhile to his great content,

<p>According to our poet, <persName key="Mercury" type="fictional">Mercury</persName> had come down from heaven, one
day, in order to make love to a nymph, famous for her beauty. He

<p>The admiration, pity, and horror, to be excited by humanity in a brute 
shape, were never perhaps called upon by a greater mixture of beauty 
and deformity than in the picture of this creature. Our pity and 
suspicions are begged by the first Word: the profuse and vital beauties with which she is covered seem proportioned to her misery and natural rights; and lest we should lose sight of them in this gorgeousness, the "woman's mouth" fills us at once with shuddering and compassion.</p>
<cit><quote>

<l>She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,</l>
<l>Vermillion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;</l>

The serpent tells <persName key="Mercury" type="fictional">Mercury</persName> that she knows upon what quest he is 
bound, and asks him if he has succeeded. The god, with the usual 
eagerness of his species to have his will, falls into the trap; and tells 
her that he will put her in possession of any wish she may have at 
heart, provided she can tell him where to find his nymph. As eagerly, 
she accepts his promise, making him ratify it by an oath, which he first 
pronounces with an earnest lightness, and afterwards with a deeper 
solemnity.</p>

<l>Then once again the charmed God began</l>

<p>The creature tells him that it was she who had rendered the nymph 
invisible, in order to preserve her from the importunities of the ruder 
wood gods. She adds, that she was a woman herself, that she loves a 
youth of <placeName type="region" corresp="Greece" key="Corinth" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103011">Corinth</placeName> and wishes tO be a woman again, and that if he will 
let her breathe upon his eyes, he shall see his invisible beauty. The 
god sees, loves, and prevails. The serpent undergoes a fierce and 
convulsive change, and flies towards <placeName type="region" corresp="Greece" key="Corinth" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103011">Corinth</placeName>,</p>

<p><persName key="Lamia" type="fictional">Lamia</persName>, whose liability to painful metamorphosis was relieved by a 
supernatural imagination, had been attracted by the beauty of <persName type="real" ref="#lycius">Lycius</persName>, 
while pitching her mind among the enjoyments of <placeName type="region" corresp="Greece" key="Corinth" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103011">Corinth</placeName>. By the 
same process, she knew that he was to pass along, that evening, on the 
road from the sea-side to <placeName type="region" corresp="Greece" key="Corinth" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103011">Corinth</placeName>; and there accordingly she contrives 
to have an interview, which ends in his being smitten with love, and 
conducting her to her pretended home in that city. She represents 
herself as a rich orphan, living "but half-retired," and affects to won- 
der that he never saw her before. As they enter <placeName type="region" corresp="Greece" key="Corinth" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103011">Corinth</placeName>, they pass 
the philosopher <persName type="real" key="Apollonius of Tyana">Apollonius</persName>, who is <persName type="real" ref="#lycius">Lycius</persName>'s tutor, and from whom he 
instinctively conceals his face. <persName key="Lamia" type="fictional">Lamia</persName>'s hand shudders in that of her

they stop at the entrance of a magnificent house:-</p>

<p>Here they lived for some time, undisturbed by the world, in all the

<p><persName key="John Keats" type="real" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/John_Keats">Mr. Keats</persName> has departed as much from common-place in the character and moral of this story, as he has in the poetry of it. He would see 
fair play to the serpent, and makes the power of the philosopher an ill-natured and disturbing thing. <persName key="Lamia" type="fictional">Lamia</persName> though liable to be turned into

painful shapes had a soul of humanity; and the poet does not see why 
she should not have her pleasures accordingly, merely because a phi- 
losopher saw that she was not a mathematical truth. This is fine and 
good. It is vindicating the greater philosophy of poetry. At the 
same time, we wish that for the purpose of his story he had not appeared 
to give into the common-place of supposing that Apollornius's sophistry 
must always prevail, and that modern experiment has done a deadly 
thing to poetry by discovering the nature of the rainbow, the air, <choice><orig>&amp;c.</orig><reg>etc.</reg></choice>: that is to say, that the knowledge of natural history and physics, by 
<choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice>ing us the nature of things, does away the imaginations that once adorned them. This is a condescension to a learned vulgarism, which 
so excellent a poet as <persName key="John Keats" type="real" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/John_Keats">Mr. Keats</persName> ought not to have made. The world 
will always have fine poetry, as long as it has events, passions, atfectious, and a philosophy that sees deeper than this philosophy. There will be a poetry of the heart, as long as there are tears and smiles: there will be a poetry of the imagination, as long as the first causes of 
things remain a mystery. A man who is no poet, may think he is 
none, as soon as he finds out the physical cause of the rainbow; but 
he need not alarm himself: — he was none before. The true poet will 
go deeper. He will ask himself what is the cause of that physical 
cause; whether truths to the senses are after all to be taken as truths 
to the imagination; and whether there is not room and mystery enough 
in the universe for the creation of infinite things, when the poor matter-of-fact philosopher has come to the end of his own vision. It is remarkable that an age of poetry has grown up with the progress of experiment; and that the very poets, who seem to countenance these notions, 
accompany them by some of their finest effusions. Even if there 
were nothing new, to be created,— if philosophy, with its line and rule, 
could even score the ground, and say to poetry "Thou shalt go no 
further," she would look back to the old world, and still find it inexhaustible. The crops from its fertility are endless. But these alarms are altogether idle. The essence of poetical enjoyment does 
not consist in belief, but in a voluntary power to imagine.</p>

<p>The next story, that of the <title key="Isabella, or the Pot of Basil" level="a" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/Isabella,_or_the_Pot_of_Basil">Pot of Basil</title>, is from <persName type="real" key="Giovanni Boccaccio" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/Giovanni_Boccaccio">Boccaccio</persName>. After the narrative of that great writer, we must make as short work of it as possible in prose. To turn one of his stories into verse, is another 
thing. It is like setting it to a more elaborate music. <persName key="John Keats" type="real" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/John_Keats">Mr. Keats</persName> is so struck with admiration of his author, that eyen while giving him this 
accompaniment, he breaks out into an apology to the great Italian, 
asking pardon for this</p>

<p>We might waive a repetition of the narrative altogether, as the public 
have lately been familiarized with it in the <title key="Sicilian Story" level="m" ref="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sicilian+Story+by+barry+cornwall">Sicilian Story</title> of <persName type="real" key="Bryan Waller Procte" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/Bryan_Procter">Mr. Barry Cornwall</persName>: but we cannot help calling to mind that the hero and heroine were two young and happy lovers, who kept their love a secret 
from her rich brothers; that her brothers, getting knowledge of their 
intercourse, lured him into a solitary place, and murdered him; that 
<persName type="fictional" xml:id="isabella">Isabella</persName>, informed of it by a dreary vision of her lover, found out 
where he was buried, and with the assistance of her nurse, severed 
the head from the body that she might cherish even that ghastly memorial
<pb n="342"/>
of him as a relic never to be parted with; that she buried the 
head in a pot of earth, and, planting basil over it, watered the leaves 
with her continual tears till they grew into wonderful beauty and 
luxuriance; that her brothers, prying into her fondness for the <title key="Isabella, or the Pot of Basil" level="a" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/Isabella,_or_the_Pot_of_Basil">Pot of Basil</title>, which she carried with her from place to place, contrived to steal it away; that she made such lamentations for it, as induced them to wonder what could be its value, upon which they dug into it, and discovered the head; that the amazement of that discovery struck back upon their hearts, so that after burying the head secretly, they left their native place, and went to live in another city; and that <persName key="Isabella" type="fictional">Isabella</persName> continued to cry and moan for her <title key="Isabella, or the Pot of Basil" level="a" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/Isabella,_or_the_Pot_of_Basil">Pot of Basil</title>, which she had 
not the power to cease wishing foi; till, under the pressure of that 
weeping want, she died.</p>

<p>Our author can pass to the most striking imaginations from the 
most delicate and airy fancy. He says of the lovers in their hapiness,</p>

<p><title key="The Eve of St. Agnes" level="a" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/The_Eve_of_St._Agnes">The Eve of St. Agnes</title>, which is rather a picture than a story, may 
be analysed in a few words. It is an account of a young beauty, who 
going to bed on the eve in question to dream of her lover, while her 
rich kinsmen, the opposers of his love, are keeping holday in the rest 
of the house, finds herself waked by him in the night, and in the hurry 
of the moment agrees to elope with him. The portrait of the heroine, 
preparing to go to bed, is remarkable for its union of extreme richness 
and good taste; not that those two properties of description are naturally 
<pb n="344"/>
distinct; but that they are too often separated by very good 
poets, and that the passage affords a striking specimen of the sudden 
and strong maturity of the author's genius. When he wrote Endymion 
he could not have resisted doing too much. To the description before 
us, it would be a great injury either to add or diminish. It falls at 
once gorgeously and delicately upon us, like the colours of the painted 
glass. Nor is <persName key="Madeline" type="fictional">Madeline</persName> hurt by all her encrusting jewelry and rustling
