<head type="header" rend="center uppercase">Spring.—Daisies.—Gathering Flowers</head>
<p>The Spring is now complete. The winds have done their work.
The shaken air, well tempered and equalized, has subsided; the genial
rains, however thickly they may come, do not saturate the ground,
beyond the power of the sun to dry it up again. There are clear
chrystal mornings; noons of blue sky and white cloud; nights, in
which the growing moon seems to lie looking at the stars, like a
young shepherdess at her flock. A few days ago she lay gazing in
this manner at the solitary evening star, like <persName key="Diana (mythology)" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diana_(mythology)" type="fictional">Diana</persName>, on the slope of a
valley, looking up at <persName key="Endymion (mythology)" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endymion_(mythology)" type="fictional">Endymion</persName>. His young eye seemed to sparkle
out upon the world; while she, bending inwards, her hands behind
her head, watched him with an enamoured dumbness. </p>

<p>But this is the quiet of Spring. <choice><orig>It's</orig><reg>Its</reg></choice> voices and swift movements 
have come back also. The swallow shoots by us, like an embodied
ardour of the season. The glowing bee has his will of the honied 
flowers, grappling with them as they tremble. We have not yet heard 
the nightingale or the cuckoo; but we can hear them with our imagination, 
and enjoy them through the content of those who have. </p>

<p>Then the young green. This is the most apt and perfect mark of
the season,—the true issuing forth of the Spring. The trees and
bushes are putting forth their crisp fans; the lilac is loaded with bud;
the meadows are thick with the bright young grass, running into sweeps
of white and gold with the daisies and buttercups. The orchards announce
their riches, in a shower of silver blossoms. The earth in fertile
woods is spread with yellow and blue carpets of primroses, violets,
and hyacinths, over which the birch-trees, like stooping nymphs, hang

lady-smocks, and the intensely red piony which seems to anticipate
the full glow of summer-time, all come out to wait upon the season,
like fairies from their subterraneous palaces. </p>

All our kindly impulses are apt to have more sentiment in them, than 
the world suspect; and it is by fetching out this sentiment, and making 
it the ruling association, that we exalt the impulse into generosity 
and refinement, instead of degrading it, as is too much the case, into what 
is selfish, and coarse, and pollutes all <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> systems. One of the
greatest inspirers of love is gratitude,—not merely on <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> common 
grounds, but gratitude for pleasures, whether consciously or unconsciously, 
conferred. Thus we are thankful for the delight given us by 
a kind and sincere face; and if we fall in love with it, one great reason 
is, that we long to return what we have received. The same feeling 
has a considerable influence in the love that has been felt for men of 
talents, whose persons or address have not been much calculated to 
inspire it. In spring-time, joy awakens the heart: with joy, awakes 
gratitude and nature; and in our gratitude, we
return, on <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> own 
principle of participation, the love that has been shewn us. </p>

<p>This association of ideas renders solitude in spring, and solitude in 
winter, two very different things. In the latter, we are better content 
to bear the feelings of the season by ourselves:—in the former 
they are so sweet as well as so overflowing, that we long to share them. 
<persName key="William Shakespeare" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare" type="real"><choice><corr>Shakespeare</corr><sic>Shakspeare</sic></choice></persName>, in one of his sonnets, describes himself as so identifying 
the beauties of the spring with the thought of his absent mistress, that 
he says he forgot them in their own character, and played with them 
only as with her shadow. See how exquisitely he turns a commonplace 
into this fancy; and what a noble brief portrait of April he gives 
us at the beginning. There is indeed a wonderful mixture of softness 
and strength in almost every one of the lines.

<p>We owe a long debt of gratitude to the daisy; and we take this 
opportunity of discharging a millionth part of it. If we undertook to 
pay it all, we should have had to write such a book, as is never very 
likely to be written,—a journal of numberless happy hours in childhood, 
kept with the feelings of an infant and the pen of a man. For 
it would take, we suspect, a depth of delight and a subtlety of words, 
to express even the vague joy of infancy, such as our learned departures 
from natural wisdom would find it more difficult to put together, 
than criticism and comfort, or an old palate and a young relish.—
But knowledge is the widening and the brightening road that must 
conduct us back to the joys from which it led us; and which it is destined 
perhaps to secure and extend. We must not quarrel with <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> 
asperities, when we can help. </p>

<p>We do not know the Greek name of the daisy, nor do the dictionaries 
inform us; and we are not at present in the way of consulting 
books that might. We always like to see what the Greeks say to 
these things, because they had a sentiment in their enjoyments. The 
Latins called it Bellis or Bellus, as much as to say, Nice One, With 
the French and Italians it has the same name as a Pearl,—Marguerite, 
Margarita, or generally, by way of endearment, Margheretina.<note type="hunt">This word is originally Greek,—Margarites; and as the Franks probably 
brought it from <placeName type="city" key="Istanbul" corresp="Turkey">Constantinople</placeName>, perhaps they brought <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> association with the daisy 
also. </note> The 
same word was the name of a woman, and occasioned infinite intermixtures 
of compliment about pearls, daisies, and fair mistresses.

<p>It is for the same reason, that the daisy, being chiefly white, makes
such a beautiful shew in company with the butter cup. But this is

with a most delightful red. And how compactly and delicately is the

<p>But here somebody may remind us of the spring showers, and what 
drawbacks they are upon going into the fields.—Not at all so, when 
the spring is really confirmed, and the showers but April-like and at 
intervals. Let us turn our imaginations to the bright side of spring, 
and we shall forget the showers. You see they have been forgotten 
just this moment. Besides, we are not likely to stray too far into the 
fields; and if we should, are there not hats, bonnets, barns, cottages, 
elm-trees, and good wills? We may make these things zests, if we 
please, instead of drawbacks. There is a pleasant, off-hand, picturesque 
little poem, full of sprightly simplicity, written by <persName key="Franco Sacchetti">Franco 
Sacchetti</persName>, the earliest follower of <persName key="Boccaccio">Boccaccio</persName>; which will <choice><corr>show</corr><sic>shew</sic></choice> us,

rain, nor even of snakes. Eccolo.<note type="hunt"> With respect to giving the originals of what we translate, we are guided by 
this principle:—if they are easily referred to, we shall always content ourselves 
with short extracts, unless hurried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, or for 
some other special reason; if they are not so readily to be found, it will add a value 
to our little work to lay them before the reader. A volume of <title level="j">the
<hi rend="italic">Indicator</hi></title> will 
thus contain some of the best morsels of literature. In the <title level="s">Parnaso Italiano</title> it is

<persName key="Ugolin della Gherardesca" cert="low">Ugolin Ubaldini</persName>, who according to the editor is the same as the Ubaldin de la Pila

was not so likely to forget himself among the fields, as <persName key="Franco Sacchetti">Sacchetti</persName>; but whether he 
be the same person or not, the poem answers so well to the latter's character, that 
it was most probably his production. He is another instance, to be added to some 
of the most illustrious names, of the triumph of a genial imagination, and a rich indifference 
to riches, over a life of business, politics, and even honours. <persName key="Franco Sacchetti">Franco

<l>Tiensi beata, chi piu correr puote. </l>

<l>Ch'io non m'avvidi, e tutto mi bagnai. </l>

<l>Walking and musing in a wood, I saw </l>
<l>Some ladies gathering flowers, now this, now t'other, </l>
<l>And crying in delight to one another, </l>
<l>"Look here, look here: what's this? a fleur-de-lis. </l>
<l>Oh—get some violets there: </l>
<l>No, no, some roses farther onward there: </l>
<l>How beautiful they are! </l>
<l>O me! these thorns do prick so—only see:—</l>
<l>Not that; the other; reach it me. </l>
<l>Hallo, hallo! What is it leaping so? </l>
<l>A grasshopper, a grasshopper.</l>
<l>Come here, come here now, quickly,</l>
<l>The rampions grew so thickly; </l>
<l>No; they're not rampions. </l>
<l>Yes, they are:—<persName type="fictional" key="Anna">Anna</persName>, <persName type="fictional" key="Beatrice">Beatrice</persName>, or <persName type="fictional" key="Lisa">Lisa</persName>, </l>
<l>Come here, come here for mushrooms just a bit </l>
<l>There, there's the betony—you're treading it. </l>
<l>We shall be caught, the weather's going to change: </l>
<l>See, see; it lightens—hush—and there's the thunder. </l>
<l>Was that the bell for vespers too, I wonder? </l>
<l>Why, you faint-hearted thing, it isn't noon: </l>
<l>It was the nightingale—I know his tune— </l>
<l>There's something stirring there! </l>
<l>Where, where? </l>
<l>There, in the bushes." </l>
<l>Here every lady pokes, and peeps, and pushes; </l>
<l>When suddenly, in middle of the rout, </l>
<l>A great large snake comes out. </l>
<l><q>O lord ! O lord! Good heavens! O me! O me!</q> </l>
<l>And off they go, scampering with all their power, </l>
<l>While from above, down comes a pelting shower. </l>
<l rend="indent">Frightened, and scrambling, jolting one another, </l>
<l>They shriek, they run, they slide: the foot of one </l>
<l>Catches her gown, and where the foot should be </l>
<l>Down goes the knee, </l>
<l>And hands, and clothes, and all; some stumble on, </l>
<l>Brushing the hard earth off, and some the mud. </l>
<l>What they plucked, so glad and heaping, </l>
<l>Now becomes not worth their keeping. </l>
<l>Off it squirrs, leaf, root, and flower; </l>
<l>Yet not the less for that they scream and scower, </l>
<l>In such a passage, happiest she </l>
<l>Who plies her notes most rapidly. </l>
<l rend="indent">So fixed I stood, gazing at that fair set, </l>
<l>That I forgot the shower, and dripped with wet. </l>
