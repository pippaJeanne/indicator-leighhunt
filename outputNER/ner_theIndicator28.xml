                    <p>The Spring is now complete. The winds have done their work.
                        The shaken air, well tempered and equalized, has subsided; the genial
                        rains, however thickly they may come, do not saturate the ground,
                        beyond the power of the sun to dry it up again. There are clear
                        chrystal mornings; noons of blue sky and white cloud; nights, in
                        which the growing moon seems to lie looking at the stars, like a
                        young shepherdess at her flock. A few days ago she lay gazing in
                        this manner at the solitary evening star, like <persName key="Diana">Diana</persName>, on the slope of a
                        valley, looking up at Endymion. His young eye seemed to sparkle
                        out upon the world; while she, bending inwards, her hands behind
                        her head, watched him with an enamoured dumbness. </p>
                    <p>But this is the quiet of Spring. <choice>
                            <corr>Its</corr>
                            <sic>It's</sic>
                        </choice> voices and swift
                        movements have come back also. The swallow shoots by us, like an embodied
                        ardour of the season. The glowing bee has his will of the honied flowers,
                        grappling with them as they tremble. We have not yet heard the nightingale
                        or the cuckoo; but we can hear them with our imagination, and enjoy them
                        through the content of those who have. </p>
                    <p>Then the young green. This is the most apt and perfect mark of
                        the season,—the true issuing forth of the Spring. The trees and
                        bushes are putting forth their crisp fans; the lilac is loaded with bud;
                        the meadows are thick with the bright young grass, running into sweeps
                        of white and gold with the daisies and buttercups. The orchards announce
                        their riches, in a shower of silver blossoms. The earth in fertile
                        woods is spread with yellow and blue carpets of primroses, violets,
                        and hyacinths, over which the birch-trees, like stooping nymphs, hang
                        with their thickening hair. Lilies of the valley, stocks, columbines,
                        lady-smocks, and the intensely red piony which seems to anticipate
                        the full glow of summer-time, all come out to wait upon the season,
                        like fairies from their subterraneous palaces. </p>
                    <p>Who is to wonder that the idea of love mingles itself with that of this
                        cheerful and kind time of the year, setting aside even common <pb n="218" />
                        associations? It is not only it's youth, and beauty, and budding life, and <q>the

                        All our kindly impulses are apt to have more sentiment in them, than the
                        world suspect; and it is by fetching out this sentiment, and making it the
                        ruling association, that we exalt the impulse into generosity and
                        refinement, instead of degrading it, as is too much the case, into what is
                        selfish, and coarse, and pollutes all <choice>

                        greatest inspirers of love is gratitude,—not merely on <choice>

                        gratitude for pleasures, whether consciously or unconsciously, conferred.
                        Thus we are thankful for the delight given us by a kind and sincere face;
                        and if we fall in love with it, one great reason is, that we long to return
                        what we have received. The same feeling has a considerable influence in the
                        love that has been felt for men of talents, whose persons or address have
                        not been much calculated to inspire it. In spring-time, joy awakens the
                        heart: with joy, awakes gratitude and nature; and in our gratitude, we
                        return, on <choice>
                            <corr>its</corr>

                        </choice> own principle of
                        participation, the love that has been shewn us. </p>
                    <p>This association of ideas renders solitude in spring, and solitude in winter,
                        two very different things. In the latter, we are better content to bear the
                        feelings of the season by ourselves:—in the former they are so sweet as well
                        as so overflowing, that we long to share them. Shakspeare, in one of his
                        sonnets, describes himself as so identifying the beauties of the spring with
                        the thought of his absent mistress, that he says he forgot them in their own
                        character, and played with them only as with her shadow. See how exquisitely
                        he turns a commonplace into this fancy; and what a noble brief portrait of
                        April he gives us at the beginning. There is indeed a wonderful mixture of
                        softness and strength in almost every one of the lines. <cit>

                    <p>We owe a long debt of gratitude to the daisy; and we take this opportunity of
                        discharging a millionth part of it. If we undertook to pay it all, we should
                        have had to write such a book, as is never very likely to be written,—a
                        journal of numberless happy hours in childhood, kept with the feelings of an
                        infant and the pen of a man. For it would take, we suspect, a depth of
                        delight and a subtlety of words, to express even the vague joy of infancy,
                        such as our learned departures from natural wisdom would find it more
                        difficult to put together, than criticism and comfort, or an old palate and
                        a young relish.—But knowledge is the widening and the brightening road that
                        must conduct us back to the joys from which it led us; and which it is
                        destined perhaps to secure and extend. We must not quarrel with <choice>

                        always like to see what the Greeks say to these things, because they had a

                    <p>Mr. <persName key="Wordsworth">Wordsworth</persName> calls the daisy <q>an unassuming common-place of
                            Nature,</q> which it is; and he praises it very becomingly for

                        in that universal character. But we cannot agree with him in thinking that
                        it has a <q>homely face.</q> Not that we should care, if it really had; for
                        homeliness does not make ugliness; but we appeal to every body, whether it
                        is proper to say this of la belle <persName key="Marguerite">Marguerite</persName>. In the first place, <choice>

                    <p>It is for the same reason, that the daisy, being chiefly white, makes
                        such a beautiful shew in company with the butter cup. But this is
                        not all; for look at the back, and you find it's fair petals blushing
                        with a most delightful red. <persName key="And">And</persName> how compactly and delicately is the

                    <p>But here somebody may remind us of the spring showers, and what drawbacks
                        they are upon going into the fields.—Not at all so, when the spring is
                        really confirmed, and the showers but April-like and at intervals. Let us
                        turn our imaginations to the bright side of spring, and we shall forget the
                        showers. You see they have been forgotten just this moment. <placeName key='Besides'>Besides</placeName>, we are
                        not likely to stray too far into the fields; and if we should, are there not
                        hats, bonnets, barns, <placeName key='cottages'>cottages</placeName>, <placeName key='elm-trees'>elm-trees</placeName>, and good wills? We may make these
                        things zests, if we please, instead of drawbacks. There is a pleasant,
                        off-hand, picturesque little poem, full of sprightly simplicity, written by
                        <persName key="Franco <persName key="Sacchetti">Sacchetti</persName>">Franco <persName key="Sacchetti">Sacchetti</persName></persName>, the earliest follower of <persName key="Boccaccio">Boccaccio</persName>; which will shew us,
                        that the Italians are not prevented from gathering flowers by the fear of
                        rain, nor even of snakes. <persName key="Eccolo">Eccolo</persName>.<note type="hunt"> With respect to giving
                        the originals of what we translate, we are guided by this principle:—if they
                        are easily referred to, we shall always content ourselves with short
                        extracts, unless hurried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, or for some
                        other special reason; if they are not so readily to be found, it will add a
                        value to our little work to lay them before the reader. A volume of the
                        Indicator will thus contain some of the best morsels of literature. In the
                        <placeName key='Parnaso Italiano'>Parnaso Italiano</placeName>, it is doubted whether the present poem is to be assigned
                        to <persName key="Franco <persName key="Sacchetti">Sacchetti</persName>">Franco <persName key="Sacchetti">Sacchetti</persName></persName>, or to <persName key="Ugolin Ubaldini">Ugolin Ubaldini</persName>, who according to the editor is
                        the same as the Ubaldin de la Pila mentioned among the gluttons in the 24th
                        Book of Dante's Purgatory. If so, he was not so likely to forget himself
                        among the fields, as <persName key="Sacchetti">Sacchetti</persName>; but whether he be the same person or not,
                        the poem answers so well to the latter's character, that it was most
                        probably his production. He is another instance, to be added to some of the
                        most illustrious names, of the triumph of a genial imagination, and a rich
                        indifference to riches, over a life of business, politics, and even honours.
