                        go to sea again, is to take as much pleasure as he can. The moment he sets
                        his foot on dry-ground, he turns his back on all salt-beef and other
                        salt-water restrictions. His long absence, and the impossibility of getting
                        land pleasures at sea, put him upon a sort of desperate appetite. He lands,
                        like a conqueror taking possession. He has been debarred so long, that he is
                        resolved to have that matter out with the inhabitants. They must render an
                        account to him of their treasures, their women, their victualling-stores<note
                            type="editorial">Victualling was the naval practice of equipping a ship
                        with food and other supplies, as well as arms in the case of war ships. The

                        <p>Oh, forsooth, it's vulgar, Sir! So she said, when I kissed him before her
                            once; as if one's brother was'nt one's brother; and as for that, she'd
                            kiss her cousin fast enough before twenty people, if he'd make any thing
                            like an advantage. She is but a maid at boarding-school, where I was;
                            and never writes <persName key="Miss">Miss</persName> on my letters; and yet whenever she goes home to
                            her father's, who is nothing but a little petty green-grocer in an
                            alley, she insists, forsooth, on my <persName key="Miss">Miss</persName>ing and <pb n="179" /> <persName key="Miss">Miss</persName>ing
                            her, or she wont send me any news of the private theatre; and and she
                            knows that vexes me, because I really have a taste for the stage, and
                            once played second part at school to <persName key="Miss">Miss</persName> Gollogher. She was the Fair

                            a Managearee. So, Sir, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName key="Miss">Miss</persName> Sarah Jones</hi> never

                            permits me to wear my hair in a comb, to distinguish me from common

                    <p>The first object of the seaman on landing is to spend his money: but his
                        first sensation is the strange firmness of the earth, which he goes dreading
                        in a sort of heavy light way, half waggoner and half dancing-master, his
                        shoulders rolling, and his feet touching and going; the same way, in short,
                        in which he keeps himself prepared for all the rolling chances of the
                        vessel, when on deck. There is always, to us, this appearance of lightness
                        of foot and heavy strength of upper works, in a sailor. <persName key="And">And</persName> he feels it
                        himself. He lets his jacket fly open, and his shoulders slouch, and his hair
                        grow long to be gathered into a heavy pigtail; but when full dressed, he
                        prides himself on a certain gentility of toe; on a white stocking and a
                        natty shoe, issuing lightly out of the flowing blue trowser. His arms are
                        neutral, hanging and swinging in a curve aloof; his hands, half open, look
                        as if they had just been handling ropes, and had no object in life but to
                        handle them again. He is proud of appearing in a new hat and slops, with a
                        <persName key="Belcher">Belcher</persName> handkerchief flowing loosely round his neck, and the corner of
                        another out of his pocket. Thus equipped, with pinchbeck buckles in his
                        shoes (which he bought for gold) he puts some tobacco in his mouth, not as
                        if he were going to use it directly, but as if he stuffed it in a pouch on
                        one side, as a pelican does fish, to employ it hereafter: and so, with Bet
                        Monson at his side, and perhaps a cane or whanghee twisted under his other
                        arm, sallies forth to take possession of all <placeName key='Lubberland'>Lubberland</placeName>. He buys every thing
                        that he comes athwart,—nuts, gingerbread, apples, <placeName key='shoe-strings'>shoe-strings</placeName>, beer,
                        brandy, gin, buckles, knives, a watch, (two, if he has money enough), gowns
                        and handkerchiefs for Bet, and his mother and sisters, dozens of <soCalled>Best
                        Men's Cotton Stockings</soCalled>, dozens of <soCalled>Superfine Best
                            Women's Cotton Ditto</soCalled>, best good Check for Shirts (though he
                        has too much already), infinite needles and thread (to sew his trowsers with
                        some day), a footman's laced hat, Bear's Grease to make his hair grow (by
                        way of joke,) several sticks, all sorts of Jew articles, a flute (which he
                        can't play, and never intends), a leg of mutton which he carries somewhere
                        to roast, and for a piece of which the landlord of the Ship makes him pay
                        twice what he gave for the whole;—in short, all that money can be spent
                        upon, which is every thing but medicine gratis; and this he would insist on
                        paying <pb n="180" /> for. He would buy all the painted parrots on an
                        Italian's head, on purpose to break them, rather than not spend his money.
                        He has fiddles and a dance at the Ship, with oceans of flip and grog; and
                        gives the blind fiddler tobacco for sweetmeats, and half a crown for
                        treading on his toe. He asks the landlady, with a sigh, after her daughter
                        Nance who first fired his heart with her silk-stockings; and finding that
                        she is married and in trouble, leaves five crowns for her; which the old
                        lady appropriates as part payment for a shilling in advance. He goes to the
                        port playhouse with Bet Monson, and a great red handkerchief full of apples,
                        gingerbread nuts, and fresh beef; calls out for the fiddlers and Rule
                        Britannia; pelts Tom Sikes in the pit; and compares Othello to the black
                        ship's cook in his white night-cap. When he comes to London, he and some
                        messmates take a hackney-coach, full of Bet Monsons and tobacco-pipes, and
                        go through the streets smoking; and lolling out of window. He has ever been
                        cautious of venturing on horseback; and among his other sights in foreign
                        parts, relates with unfeigned astonishment how he has seen the Turks ride,—<q
                            type="spoken">Only,</q> says he, guarding against the hearer's
                        incredulity, <q type="spoken">they have saddle-boxes to hold 'em in, fore
                            and aft;
                            and shovels like for stirrups.</q> He will tell you how the Chinese
                        drink, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Negurs</hi> dance, and the monkies pelt
                        you with cocoa-nuts; and how King Domy would have built him a mud hut and
                        made him a Peer of the Realm, if he would have stopped with hira and taught
                        him to make trowsers. He has a sister at a <soCalled>School
                            for Young Ladies</soCalled>, who blushes with a mixture of pleasure and
                        shame at his appearance; and whose confusion he completes, by slipping
                        four-pence into her hand, and saying out loud that he has <q type="spoken">no
                        more
                            copper</q> about him. His mother and elder sisters at home doat on all
                        he says and does, telling him however that he is a great sea-fellow, and was
                        always wild ever since he was a hop-o'-my-thumb no higher than the
                        window-locker. He tells his mother that she would be a Duchess in Paranaboo;
                        at which the good old portly dame laughs and looks proud. When his sisters
                        complain of his romping, he says that they are only sorry it is not the
                        baker. He frightens them with a mask made after the <placeName key='New Zealand'>New Zealand</placeName> fashion, and
                        is forgiven for his learning. Their mantle-piece is filled by him with
                        shells and shark's teeth; and when he goes to sea again, there is no end of
                        tears, and God-bless yous, and home-made gingerbread.</p>
                    <p>His Officer on shore does much of all this, only, generally speaking, in a
                        higher taste. The moment he lands he buys quantities of jewellery and other
                        valuables, for all the females of his acquaintance; and is taken in for
                        every article. He sends in a cart load of fresh meat to the ship, though he
                        is going to town next day; and calling in at a chandler's for some candles,
                        is persuaded to buy a dozen of green wax, with which he lights up the ship
                        at evening; regretting that the fine moonlight hinders the effect of the
                        colour. A man, with a bundle beneath his arm, accosts him in an under-tone;
                        and, with a look in which respect for his knowledge is mixed with an avowed
                        zeal for his own interest, asks if his <persName key="Honour">Honour</persName> will just step under the
                        gangway here, and inspect some real <placeName key='India'>India</placeName> shawls. The gallant Lieutenant <pb
                            n="181" /> says to himself, <q type="spoken">fellow knows what's what,
                            by his face;</q> and so he proves it by being taken in on the spot. When
                        he brings the shawls home, he says to his sister with an air of triumph, <q
                            type="spoken">There,
                            <persName key="Poll">Poll</persName>, there's something for you; only cost me twelve, and is worth
                        twenty, if it's worth a dollar.</q> She turns pale—<q type="spoken">Twenty
                        what, my

<q
                            type="spoken">Not I, by the Lord.</q>—<q type="spoken">That's lucky;
                        because you see, my dear
                            <persName key="George">George</persName>, that all together is not worth more than fourteen or fifteen
                        shillings.</q> <q type="spoken">Fourteen or fifteen what! Why, it's real
                        <placeName key='India'>India</placeName>, en't it?
                            Why the fellow told me so; or I'm sure <persName key="I'd">I'd</persName> as soon</q>—(here he tries to
                        hide his blushes with a bluster) <q type="spoken"><persName key="I'd">I'd</persName> as soon have given him
                        twelve
                            douses on the chaps as twelve guineas.</q> <q type="spoken">Twelve <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">guineas</hi>,</q> exclaims the sister; and then
                        drawling forth <q type="spoken">Why—my—<hi rend="smallcaps">dear</hi>
                        —<persName key="George">George</persName>,</q> is proceeding to shew him what the articles would have cost at
                        Condell's, when he interrupts her by requesting her to go and chuse for
                        herself a tea-table service. He then makes his escape to some messmates at a
                        coffee-house, and drowns his recollection of the shawls in the best wine,
                        and a discussion on the comparative merits of the English and West <placeName key='India'>India</placeName>n
                        beauties and tables. At the theatre afterwards, where he has never been
                        before, he takes a lady at the back of one of the boxes for a woman of
                        quality; and when, after returning his long respectful gaze with a smile,
                        she turns aside and puts her handkerchief to her mouth, he thinks it is in
                        derision, till his friend undeceives him. He is introduced to the lady; and
                        ever afterwards, at first sight of a woman of quality (without any
                        disparagement either to those charming personages), expects her to give him
                        a smile. He thinks the other ladies much better creatures than they are
                        taken for; and for their parts, they tell him, that if all men were like
                        himself they would trust the sex again:—which, for aught we know, is the
                        truth. He has, indeed, what he thinks a very liberal opinion of ladies in
                        general; judging them all, in a manner, with the eye of a seaman's
                        experience. Yet he will believe nevertheless in the <soCalled>truelove</soCalled>
                        of any given damsel whom he seeks in the way of marriage, let him roam as
                        much, or remain as long at a distance, as he pleases. It is not that he
                        wants feeling; but that he has read of it, time out of mind, in songs; and
                        he looks upon constancy as a sort of exploit, answering to those which he
                        performs at sea. He is nice in his watches and linen. He makes you presents
                        of cornelians, antique seals, cocoa-nuts get in silver, and other valuables.
                        When he shakes hands with you, it is like being caught in a windlass. He
                        would not swagger about the streets in his uniform, for the world. He is
                        generally modest in company, though liable to be irritated by what he thinks
                        ungentlemanly behaviour. He is also liable to be rendered irritable by
                        sickness; partly because he has been used to command others, and to be
                        served with all possible deference and alacrity; and partly, because the
                        idea of suffering pain, without any honour or profit to get by it, is
                        unprofessional, and he is not accustomed to it. He treats talents unlike his
                        own with great respect. He often perceives his own so little felt that it
                        teaches him this feeling for that of others. Besides, he admires the
                        quantity of information which people can get, <pb n="182" /> without
                        travelling like himself; especially when he sees how interesting his own
                        becomes, to them as well as to every body else. When he tells a story,
                        particularly if full of wonders, he takes care to maintain his character for
                        truth and simplicity, by qualifying it with all possible reservations,
                        concessions, and anticipations of objection; such as <q type="term">in
                            case, at such times as, so to speak, as it were, at least, at any rate.</q>
                        He seldom uses sea-terms but when jocosely provoked by something contrary to
                        his habits of life; as for instance, if he is always meeting you on
                        horseback, he asks if you never mean to walk the deck again; or if he finds
                        you studying day after day, he says you are always overhauling your
                        log-book. He makes more new acquaintances, and forgets his old ones less,
                        than any other man in the busy world; for he is so compelled to make his
                        home every where, remembers his native one as such a place of enjoyment, has
                        all his friendly recollections so fixed upon his mind at sea, and has so
                        much to tell and to hear when he returns, that change and separation lose
                        with him the most heartless part of their nature. He also sees such a
                        variety of customs and manners, that he becomes charitable in his opinions
                        altogether; and charity, while it diffuses the affections, cannot let the
                        old ones go. Half the secret of human intercourse is to make allowance for
                        each other. </p>
                    <p>When the Officer is superannuated or retires, he becomes, if intelligent
                        and enquiring, one of the most agreeable old men in the world,
                        equally welcome to the silent for his card-playing, and to the
                        conversational
                        for his recollections. He is fond of astronomy and books of
                        voyages, and is immortal with all who know him for having been round
                        the world, or seen the <placeName key='Transit of Venus'>Transit of Venus</placeName>, or had one of his fingers carried
                        off by a <placeName key='New Zealand'>New Zealand</placeName> hatchet, or a present of feathers from an
                        <placeName key='Otaheitean'>Otaheitean</placeName> beauty. If not elevated by his acquirements above some
                        of his humbler tastes, he delights in a corner-cupboard holding his
                        cocoa-nuts and punchbowl; has his summer-house castellated and
                        planted with wooden cannon; and sets up the figure of his old ship,
                        the Britannia or the <persName key="Love">Love</persName>ly Nancy, for a statue in the garden; where
                        it stares eternally with red cheeks and round black eyes, as if in
                        astonishment at it's situation. </p>
                    <p><persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>, who wrote his Canterbury Tales about four hundred and thirty years
                        ago, has among his other characters in that work a <persName key="Shipman">Shipman</persName>, who is exactly
                        of the same cast as the modern sailor,—the same robustness, courage, and
                        rough drawn virtue, doing it's duty, without being very nice in helping
                        itself to it's recreations. There is the very dirk, the complexion, the
                        jollity, the experience, and the bad horsemanship. The plain unaffected
                        ending of the description has the air of a sailor's own speech; while the
                        line about the beard is exceedingly picturesque, poetical, and
                        comprehensive. In copying it out, we shall merely alter the old spelling,
                        where the words are still modern. <cit>

                        The story he tells is a well-known one in the Italian novels, of a monk who
                        made love to a merchant's wife, and borrowed a hundred franks of the husband
                        to give her. She accordingly admits his addresses during the absence of her
                        good man on a journey. When the latter returns, he applies to the cunning
                        monk for repayment, and is deferred to the lady; who thus finds her
                        mercenary behaviour outwitted. </p>
