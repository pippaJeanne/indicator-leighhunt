<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> sole business of a seaman on shore, who has to go to sea again, 
is to take as much pleasure as he can. The moment he sets his foot 
on dry-ground, he turns his back on all salt-beef and other salt-water 
restrictions. His long absence, and the impossibility of getting land 
pleasures at sea, put him upon a sort of desperate appetite. He lands,
like a conqueror taking possession. He has been debarred so long, 
that he is resolved to have that matter out with the inhabitants. They 
must render an account to him of their treasures, their women, their 
victualling-stores<note type="editorial">Victualling was the naval practice of equipping a ship with food and other supplies, as well as arms in the case of war ships. The Victualling Yard in Deptford, established in 1743, was perhaps the UK's first large-scale food manufacturing initiative. See

</sp>
<sp who="#lady-m">

<p>Oh,  Sir, if my lady does not think it vulgar, I'm sure
I shan't; for there isn't a more delicater nor more genteeler person

But you mentioned something about alehouses, or inns, or something;
and you know they are rather vulgar. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#indi">

<p>I'm sure, <persName key="Mrs. Jane">Mrs. Jane</persName>, I didn't think so, three years back,
when you handed me that frothed glass of porter, with your pretty

a witch! Who'd have thought you'd have ever known that I kept my

great aunt, who wouldn't let her come home one night in the shay,
because she had married <persName key="Tom Butts">Tom Butts</persName> after being the wife of a Serjeant

and a man in a vulgarish situation, he was as well-behaved a man

kind and good-natured, and was as free from pride, and said as civil
things to a body—— </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#lady">
<speaker>Lady. </speaker>
<p>In short, <persName key="Mrs. Jane">Jane</persName>, he was not vulgar, and your dear old vixen

<p>Lord, Ma'am, and did you see me kiss my poor brother
<persName key="William">William</persName>? For it was my own brother. Ma'am, who you've

he had to cross the whole country to his home, and had spent all his
money at <placeName type="city" key="Portsmouth" corresp="England" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q72259">Portsmouth</placeName>; and so I gave him my box of half-crowns, and
he's now captain's clerk's man, and it was he as sent me that live tortoise
that made me scream so, and the cocoa-cup, and the shawl, and
the purse made of grass, and the Hoty-hity feathers; and I do think, if

<p>Good. Now there you come round, <persName key="Mrs. Jane">Mrs. Jane</persName>, to the true

<p>Oh, forsooth, <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> vulgar, Sir! So she said, when I kissed

for that, she'd kiss her cousin fast enough before twenty people, if he'd 
make any thing like an advantage. She is but a maid at boarding-school, 
where I was; and never writes Miss on my letters; and yet 
whenever she goes home to her father's, who is nothing but a little 
petty green-grocer in an alley, she insists, forsooth, on my Missing and

Missing her, or she wont send me any news of the private theatre; and 
and she knows that vexes me, because I really have a taste for the stage, 
and once played second part at school to Miss Gollogher. She 
was the Fair Penitent, Sir; a tall brown girl, <hi rend="smallcaps">horn-bone pine</hi><note type="editorial">un bon point?</note>, as the 
French say; and a great fortune, though her father did keep a dog-shop.

never condescends to write Miss to me, though she daredn't wear her 
hair without a cap at boarding-school, to save her head; and my lady 
always permits me to wear my hair in a comb, to distinguish me from 
common helpers and such like. And besides that, though I have worn 
a cap, I never wore black worsted stockings as she does; nor never 
set mop upon floor. As to sailors, she cannot abide <choice><corr>'em</corr><sic>'en</sic></choice>. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#indi">
<speaker>Indic. </speaker>
<p>But you, <persName key="Mrs. Jane">Mrs. Jane</persName>, can: and let me tell you, that that is not
the least advantage which you have over <persName key="Miss Sarah Jones">Miss Sarah Jones</persName>. So we will
go on with our picture. </p>
</sp>
<p>The first object of the seaman on landing is to spend his money: but 
his first sensation is the strange firmness of the earth, which he goes 
dreading in a sort of heavy light way, half waggoner and half dancing-master, 
his shoulders rolling, and his feet touching and going; the 
same way, in short, in which he keeps himself prepared for all the rolling 
chances of the vessel, when on deck. There is always, to us, this 
appearance of lightness of foot and heavy strength of upper works, in a 
sailor. And he feels it himself. He lets his jacket fly open, and his 
shoulders slouch, and his hair grow long to be gathered into a heavy 
pigtail; but when full dressed, he prides himself on a certain gentility 
of toe; on a white stocking and a natty shoe, issuing lightly out of the 
flowing blue trowser. His arms are neutral, hanging and swinging in a 
curve aloof; his hands, half open, look as if they had just been 
handling ropes, and had no object in life but to handle them again. He 
is proud of appearing in a new hat and slops, with a Belcher handkerchief 
flowing loosely round his neck, and the corner of another out of 
his pocket. Thus equipped, with pinchbeck buckles in his shoes 
(which he bought for gold) he puts some tobacco in his mouth, not as if 
he were going to use it directly, but as if he stuffed it in a pouch on
one side, as a pelican does fish, to employ it hereafter: and so, with 
<persName key="Elizabeth Monson">Bet Monson</persName> at his side, and perhaps a cane or whanghee twisted under 
his other arm, sallies forth to take possession of all Lubberland. He 
buys every thing that he comes athwart,—nuts, gingerbread, apples, 
shoe-strings, beer, brandy, gin, buckles, knives, a watch, (two, if he 
has money enough), gowns and handkerchiefs for <persName key="Elizabeth Monson">Bet</persName>, and his mother 
and sisters, dozens of <q type="soCalled">Superfine Best Men's Cotton Stockings,</q> 
dozens of <q type="soCalled">Superfine Best Women's Cotton Ditto,</q> best good Check 
for Shirts (though he has too much already), infinite needles and thread 
(to sew his trowsers with some day), a footman's laced hat, Bear's 
Grease to make his hair grow (by way of joke,) several sticks, all sorts 
of Jew articles, a flute (which he can't play, and never intends), a leg 
of mutton which he carries somewhere to roast, and for a piece of 
which the landlord of the Ship makes him pay twice what he gave for 
the whole;—in short, all that money can be spent upon, which is 
every thing but medicine gratis; and this he would insist on paying 

<pb n="180"/>

for. He would buy all the painted parrots on an Italian's head, 
on purpose to break them, rather than not spend his money. He has 
fiddles and a dance at the Ship, with oceans of flip and grog; and gives 
the blind fiddler tobacco for sweetmeats, and half a crown for treading 
on his toe. He asks the landlady, with a sigh, after her daughter
<persName key="Nance">Nance</persName> who first fired his heart with her silk-stockings; and finding 
that she is married and in trouble, leaves five crowns for her; which 
the old lady appropriates as part payment for a shilling in advance. 
He goes to the port playhouse with <persName key="Elizabeth Monson">Bet Monson</persName>, and a great red handkerchief 
full of apples, gingerbread nuts, and fresh beef; calls out for 
the fiddlers and Rule Britannia; pelts <persName key="Tom Sikes">Tom Sikes</persName> in the pit; and compares 
<persName key="Othello" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Othello" type="fictional">Othello</persName> to the black ship's cook in his white night-cap. When 
he comes to <placeName type="city" key="London" corresp="England" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84">London</placeName>, he and some messmates take a hackney-coach, full 
of <persName key="Elizabeth Monson">Bet Monson</persName>s and tobacco-pipes, and go through the streets smoking 
and lolling out of window. He has ever been cautious of venturing 
on horseback; and among his other sights in foreign parts, 
relates with unfeigned astonishment how he has seen the Turks 
ride,—<q type="spoken">Only,</q> says he, guarding against the hearer's incredulity, 
<q type="spoken">they have saddle-boxes to hold 'em in, fore and aft; 
and shovels like for stirrups.</q> He will tell you how the Chinese
drink, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Negurs</hi> dance, and the <choice><corr>monkeys</corr><sic>monkies</sic></choice> pelt you 
with cocoa-nuts; and how <persName key="King Domy">King Domy</persName> would have built him a mud hut 
and made him a Peer of the Realm, if he would have stopped with 
him and taught him to make <choice><corr>trousers</corr><sic>trowsers</sic></choice>. He has a sister at a <q type="soCalled">School
for Young Ladies,</q> who blushes with a mixture of pleasure and shame 
at his appearance; and whose confusion he completes, by slipping
four-pence into her hand, and saying out loud that he has <q type="distinct">no more
copper</q> about him. His mother and elder sisters at home doat on all
he says and does, telling him however that he is a great sea-fellow, 
and was always wild ever since he was a hop-o'-my-thumb no higher 
than the window-locker. He tells his mother that she would be a 
Duchess in <placeName type="fictional" key="Paranaboo">Paranaboo</placeName>; at which the good old portly dame laughs and 
looks proud. When his sisters complain of his romping, he says that 
they are only sorry it is not the baker. He frightens them with a 
mask made after the <placeName type="country" key="New Zealand" corresp="New Zealand" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q664">New Zealand</placeName> fashion, and is forgiven for his 
learning. Their mantle-piece is filled by him with shells and shark's 
teeth; and when he goes to sea again, there is no end of tears, and 
God-bless yous, and home-made gingerbread.</p>

<p>His Officer on shore does much of all this, only, generally speaking, in a
higher taste. The moment he lands he buys quantities of jewellery 
and other valuables, for all the females of his acquaintance; and 
is taken in for every article. He sends in a cart load of fresh meat to 
the ship, though he is going to town next day; and calling in at a 
chandler's for some candles, is persuaded to buy a dozen of green wax, 
with which he lights up the ship at evening; regretting that the fine 
moonlight hinders the effect of the colour. A man, with a bundle 
beneath his arm, accosts him in an under-tone; and, with a look in 
which respect for his knowledge is mixed with an avowed zeal for his 
own interest, asks if his Honour will just step under the gangway 
here, and inspect some real <placeName type="country" key="India" corresp="India" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q668">India</placeName> shawls. The gallant Lieutenant 

<pb n="181"/> 

says to himself, <q type="thought">This fellow knows what's what, by his face;</q> and 
so he proves it by being taken in on the spot. When he brings the 
shawls home, he says to his sister with an air of triumph, <q type="spoken">There,
<persName key="Poll">Poll</persName>, there's something for you; only cost me twelve, and is worth
twenty, if it's worth a dollar.</q> She turns pale—<q type="spoken">Twenty what, my
dear <persName key="George">George</persName>? Why, you haven't given twelve dollars for it, I hope?</q> 
<q type="spoken">Not I, by the Lord.</q>—<q type="spoken">That's lucky; because you see, my dear 
<persName key="George">George</persName>, that all together is not worth more than fourteen or fifteen
shillings.</q> <q type="spoken">Fourteen or fifteen what! Why, it's real <placeName type="country" key="India" corresp="India">India</placeName>, en't it?
Why the fellow told me so; or I'm sure I'd as soon</q>—(here he tries 
to hide his blushes with a bluster) <q type="spoken">I'd as soon have given him twelve
douses on the chaps as twelve guineas.</q> <q type="spoken">Twelve <hi rend="smallcaps">guineas</hi>,</q> exclaims 
the sister; and then drawling forth <q type="spoken">Why—my—<hi rend="smallcaps">dear</hi>
—<persName key="George">George</persName>,</q> is proceeding to shew him what the articles would have cost 
at <placeName type="commerce" key="Condell's" corresp="England">Condell's</placeName>, when he interrupts her by requesting her to go and 
<choice><corr>choose</corr><sic>chuse</sic></choice> for herself a tea-table service. He then makes his escape to 
some messmates at a coffee-house, and drowns his recollection of the 
shawls in the best wine, and a discussion on the comparative merits of 
the English and West Indian beauties and tables. At the theatre 
afterwards, where he has never been before, he takes a lady at the 
back of one of the boxes for a woman of quality; and when, after 
returning his long respectful gaze with a smile, she turns aside and 
puts her handkerchief to her mouth, he thinks it is in derision, till his 
friend undeceives him. He is introduced to the lady; and ever afterwards, 
at first sight of a woman of quality (without any disparagement 
either to those charming personages), expects her to give him a 
smile. He thinks the other ladies much better creatures than they are
taken for; and for their parts, they tell him, that if all men were like
himself they would trust the sex again:—which, for aught we know, 
is the truth. He has, indeed, what he thinks a very liberal opinion of 
ladies in general; judging them all, in a manner, with the eye of a 
seaman's experience. Yet he will believe nevertheless in the <q type="soCalled">true-love</q>
of any given damsel whom he seeks in the way of marriage, let 
him roam as much, or remain as long at a distance, as he pleases. It 
is not that he wants feeling; but that he has read of it, time out of 
mind, in songs; and he looks upon constancy as a sort of exploit, 
answering to those which he performs at sea. He is nice in his 
watches and linen. He makes you presents of cornelians, antique 
seals, cocoa-nuts get in silver, and other valuables. When he shakes 
hands with you, it is like being caught in a windlass. He would not 
swagger about the streets in his uniform, for the world. He is generally 
modest in company, though liable to be irritated by what he 
thinks ungentlemanly behaviour. He is also liable to be rendered 
irritable by sickness; partly because he has been used to command 
others, and to be served with all possible deference and alacrity; and 
partly, because the idea of suffering pain, without any honour or profit 
to get by it, is unprofessional, and he is not accustomed to it. He 
treats talents unlike his own with great respect. He often perceives 
his own so little felt that it teaches him this feeling for that of others. 
Besides, he admires the quantity of information which people can get, 

<pb n="182"/> 

without travelling like himself; especially when he sees how interesting 
his own becomes, to them as well as to every body else. When he 
tells a story, particularly if full of wonders, he takes care to maintain 
his character for truth and simplicity, by qualifying it with all possible 
reservations, concessions, and anticipations of objection; such as <q type="distinct">in
case, at such times as, so to speak, as it were, at least, at any rate.</q>
He seldom uses sea-terms but when jocosely provoked by something contrary 
to his habits of life; as for instance, if he is always meeting you on
horseback, he asks if you never mean to walk the deck again; or if he 
finds you studying day after day, he says you are always overhauling 
your log-book. He makes more new acquaintances, and forgets his old 
ones less, than any other man in the busy world; for he is so compelled 
to make his home every where, remembers his native one as 
such a place of enjoyment, has all his friendly recollections so fixed 
upon his mind at sea, and has so much to tell and to hear when he returns, 
that change and separation lose with him the most heartless part 
of their nature. He also sees such a variety of customs and manners, 
that he becomes charitable in his opinions altogether; and charity, 
while it diffuses the affections, cannot let the old ones go. Half the 
secret of human intercourse is to make allowance for each other. </p>

<p>When the Officer is superannuated or retires, he becomes, if intelligent
and enquiring, one of the most agreeable old men in the world,
equally welcome to the silent for his card-playing, and to the conversational
for his recollections. He is fond of astronomy and books of
voyages, and is immortal with all who know him for having been round
the world, or seen the Transit of Venus, or had one of his fingers carried
off by a <placeName type="country" key="New Zealand" corresp="New Zealand">New Zealand</placeName> hatchet, or a present of feathers from an
Otaheitean beauty. If not elevated by his acquirements above some
of his humbler tastes, he delights in a corner-cupboard holding his
cocoa-nuts and punchbowl; has his summer-house castellated and
planted with wooden cannon; and sets up the figure of his old ship,
the Britannia or the Lovely Nancy, for a statue in the garden; where
it stares eternally with red cheeks and round black eyes, as if in
astonishment at <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> situation. </p>

<p><persName key="Geoffrey Chaucer" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Chaucer" type="real">Chaucer</persName>, who wrote his <title key="The Canterbury Tales" level="s" ref="https://dbpedia.org/page/The_Canterbury_Tales">Canterbury Tales</title> about four hundred and 
thirty years ago, has among his other characters in that work a <persName type="fictional" key="The Shipman">Shipman</persName>, 
who is exactly of the same cast as the modern sailor,—the same 
robustness, courage, and rough drawn virtue, doing <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> duty, without 
being very nice in helping itself to <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> recreations. There is the very 
dirk, the complexion, the jollity, the experience, and the bad horsemanship. 
The plain unaffected ending of the description has the air 
of a sailor's own speech; while the line about the beard is exceedingly 
picturesque, poetical, and comprehensive. In copying it out, 
we shall merely alter the old spelling, where the words are still 
modern.

The story he tells is a well-known one in the Italian novels, of a monk 
who made love to a merchant's wife, and borrowed a hundred franks 
of the husband to give her. She accordingly admits his addresses 
during the absence of her good man on a journey. When the latter 
returns, he applies to the cunning monk for repayment, and is 
deferred to the lady; who thus finds her mercenary behaviour outwitted. </p>
