                    <p>If you are melancholy for the first time, you will find upon a little  
enquiry, that others have been melancholy many times, and yet are  
cheerful now. If you have been melancholy many times, recollect  
that you have got over all those times; and try if you cannot find  
out new means of getting over them better. </p>

<p>Do not imagine that mind alone is concerned in your bad spirits.  
The body has a great deal to do with these matters. The mind may  
undoubtedly affect the body; but the body also affects the mind.  
There is a mutual re-action between them; and by lessening it on  
either side, you diminish the pain on both. </p>

<p>If you are melancholy, and know not why, be assured it m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t  
arise entirely from some physical weakness; and do your best to  
strengthen yourself. The blood of a melancholy man is thick and slow.  
The blood of a lively man is clear and quick. Endeavour therefore  
to put your blood in motion. Exercise is the best way to do it; but  
you may also help yourself, in moderation, with wine, or other  
excitements. Only you m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t take care so to proportion the <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e of any  
artificial stimul<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, that it may not render the blood languid by over-  
exciting it at first; and that you may be able to keep up, by the  
natural stimul<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> only, the help you have given yourself by the artificial.  
Regard the bad weather, as somebody has advised <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> to handle the  
nettle. In proportion as you are delicate with it, it will make you  
feel but </p>

<lg><l><placeName key='Grasp'>Grasp</placeName> it like a man of mettle. </l> 
<l><persName key="And">And</persName> the rogue obeys you well. </l></lg>

<p>Do not the less however, on that account, take all reasonable  
precaution and arms against it, — your boots, etc. against wet feet,  
and your great coat or umbrella against the rain. It is timidity and  
flight, which are to be deprecated, not proper armour for the battle.  
Tht first will lay you open to defeat, on the least attack. A proper  
<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e of the latter will only keep you strong for it. <persName key="Plato">Plato</persName> had such  
a high opinion of exercise, that he said it was a cure even for a  

<pb n="34"/>

wounded conscience. Nor is this opinion a dangero<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> one. For  
there is no system, even of superstition, however severe or cruel in  
other matters, that does not allow a wounded conscience to be curable  
by some means. Nature will work out it's rights and it's kindness  
some way or other, through the worst sophistications; and this is  
one of the instances in which she seems to raise herself above all  
contingencies. The conscience may have been wounded by artificial  
or by real guilt; but then she will tell it in those extremities, that  
even the real guilt may have been produced by circumstances. It  
is her kindness alone, which nothing can pull down from it's <choice>
<orig>pre-dominance</orig>
<reg>predominance</reg>
</choice>. </p>

<p>See fair play between cares and pastimes. Diminish your mere  
wants as much as possible, whether you are rich or poor: for the  
rich man's wants, increasing by indulgence, are apt to outweigh  
even the abundance of his means; and the poor man's diminution  
of them renders his means the greater. Do not want money, for  
instance, for money's sake. There is excitement in the pursuit; but it  
is dashed with more troubles than most others, and gets less happiness  
at last. On the other hand, increase all your natural and healthy  
enjoyments. Cultivate your afternoon fireside, the society of your  
friends, the company of agreeable children, m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ic, theatres, am<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ing  
books, an urbane and genero<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> gallantry. He who thinks any  
innocent pastime foolish, has either yet to grow wiser or is past it.  
In the one case, his notion of being childish is itself a childish  
notion. In the other, his importance is of so feeble and hollow a cast,  
that it dare not move for fear of tumbling to pieces. </p>

<p>A friend of ours, who knows as well as any man how to unite  
ind<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>try with enjoyment, has set an excellent example to those who  
can afford the leisure, by taking two <persName key="Sabbaths">Sabbaths</persName> every week instead of  
one;— not Methodistical <persName key="Sabbaths">Sabbaths</persName>, but days of rest which pay true  
homage to the Supreme Being by enjoying his creation. He will  
be gratified at reading this paragraph on his second-Sunday morning. </p>

<p>One of the best pieces of advice for an ailing spirit is to go to  
no sudden extremes, — to adopt no great and extreme changes in  
diet or other habits. They may make a man look very great and  
philosophic to his own mind; but they are not fit for a nature, to  
which c<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>tom has been truly said to be a second nature. Dr. <placeName key='Cheyne'>Cheyne</placeName>  
(as we remember reading on a stall) may tell <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> that a drowning  
man cannot too quickly get himself out of the water: but the  
analogy is not good. If the water has become a second habit, he might  
almost as well say that a fish could not get too quickly out of it. </p>

<p>Upon this point. <persName key="Bacon">Bacon</persName> says that we should discontinue what we  
think hurtful by little and little. <persName key="And">And</persName> he quotes with admiration  
the advice of <persName key="Cels<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>">Cels<placeName key='us'>us</placeName></persName>, — that "a man do vary and interchange  
contraries, but rather with an inclination to the more benign extreme."  
"Use fasting," he says, "and full eatipg, but rather full eating;  
watching and sleep, but rather sleep; sitting and exercise, but  
rather exercise, and the like, so shall nature be cherished, and yet   
taught masteries." </p>

<pb n="35"/>

<p>We cannot do better than conclude with one or two other passages  
out of the same Essay, full of his <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual calm wisdom. "If you fly  
physic in health altogether, it will be too strange for your body when  
you need it." (He means that a general state of health should not make  
<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> over-confident and contemptuo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> of physic; but that we should  
<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e it moderately if required, that it may not be too strange to <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>  
when required most.) "If you make it too familiar, it will have  
no extraordinary effect when sickness cometh. I commend rather  
some diet for certain seasons, than frequent <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e of physic, except it  
be grown into a c<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>tom: for those diets alter the body more, and  
trouble it less." </p>

<p>"As for the passions and studies of the mind," says he, "avoid  
envy, anxio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> fears, anger fretting inwards, subtil and knotty  
inquisitions, joys and exhilirations in excess, sadness not communicated"  
(for as he says finely, somewhere else. They who keep their griefs  
to themselves, are "cannibals of their own hearts.") "Entertain  
hopes; mirth rather than joy;" (that is to say, cheerfulness rather  
than what we call boistero<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> merriment); "variety of delights  
rather than surfeit of them; wonder and admiration, and therefore  
novelties; studies that fill the mind with splendid and ill<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>trio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>  
objects, as histories, fables, and contemplations of nature." </p>

<head type="header">CHARLES BRANDON, AND MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE. </head>

<p>The fortune of <persName key="Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName>">Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName></persName> was remarkable. He was an  
honest man, yet the favourite of a despot. He was brave, handsome,  
accomplished, possessed even delicacy of sentiment; yet he  
retained his favour to the last. He even had the perilo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> honour of  
being beloved by the despot's sister, without having the least claim  
to it by birth; and yet instead of it's destroying them both, he was  
allowed to be her h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>band. </p>

<p><persName key="Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName>">Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName></persName> was the son of Sir <persName key="William <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName>">William <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName></persName>, whose skull

<p>The father's fate m<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t doubtless have had it's effect in securing the 
fortunes of the son. <persName key="Young <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName>">Young <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName></persName>, we believe, grew up with <persName key="Henry">Henry</persName>  
the Seventh's children, and was the playmate of his future king and  
bride. The prince, as he increased in years, seems to have carried  
the idea of <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName> vnth him like that of a second self; and the  

<pb n="36"/>

princess, whose affection was not hindered from becoming personal  
by any thing sisterly, nor on the other hand allowed to waste itself  
in too equal a familiarity, may have felt a double impulse given to  
it by the great improbability of her ever being suffered to become  
his wife. Royal females in most countries have certainly none of the  
advantages of their rank, whatever the males may have. Mary was  
destined to taste the <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual bitterness of their lot; but she was amply  
repaid. At the concl<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ion of the war with France, she was married  
to the old king Louis the Twelfth, who witnessed from a couch the  
exploits of her future h<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>band at the tournaments. The doings of  
<persName key="Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName>">Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName></persName> that time were long remembered. The love between  
him and the young queen was s<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>pected by the French courts  
and he had j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t seen her enter Paris in the midst of a gorgeo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>  
procession, like Aurora come to mairy Tithon<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. He dealt his  
chivalry about him accordingly with such irresistible vigour, that  
the Dauphin, in a fit of jealo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>y, secretly introduced into the contest  
a huge German, who was thought to be of a strength incomparable.  
But <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName> grappled with him, and with seeming disdain and  
detection so pummelled him about the head with the hilt of his  
sword, that the blood burst through the vizor. Imagine the feelings  
of the queen, when he cameand made her an offering of the German's  
shield. Drayton, in his Heroical Epistles, we know not on  
what authority, tells <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, that on one occasion during the combats,  
perhaps this particular one, she could not help saying out loud,  
"<persName key="Hurt">Hurt</persName> not my sweet Charles," or words to that effect. He then  
pleasantly represents her as doing away s<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>picion by falling to  
commendation of the Dauphin, and affecting not to know who the  
conquering knight was; — an ignorance not very probable; but the  
knights sometimes disguised themselves purposely. </p>

<p>The old king did not long survive his festivities. He died in less  
than three months, on the first day of the year 1515 3 and <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName>,  
who had been created Duke of Suffolk the year before, re-appeared  
at the French court, with letters of condolence, and more persuasive  
looks. The royal widow was young, beautiful, and rich; and it was  
likely that her hand would be sought by many princely lovers; but  
she was now resolved to reward herself for her late sacrifice, and in  
less than two months she privately married her first love. The  
queen, says a homely but not mean poet (Warner, in his Albion's  
<placeName key='England'>England</placeName>) thought that to cast too many doubts </p>

<lg><lg xml:id="verse1"><l>Were oft to erre no lesse </l>
<l>Than to be rash : and th<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> no doubt </l>

<lg xml:id="verse4"><l>Then kisses revelled on their lips, </l>

<p><persName key="Henry">Henry</persName> shewed great anger at first, real or pretended; but he had  
not then been pampered into unbearable self-will by a long reign of  

<pb n="37"/>

tyranny.  He soon forgave his sister and friend; and they were  
publicly wedded at Greenwich on the 13th of May. </p>

<p>It was during the festivities on this occasion (at least we believe  
so, for we have not the chivalro<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> Lord <persName key="Herbert">Herbert</persName>'s life of <persName key="Henry">Henry</persName> the  
8th by <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, which is most probably the authority for the story; and  
being a good thing, it is omitted, as <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual, by his historians) that  
<persName key="Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName>">Charles <persName key="Brandon">Brandon</persName></persName> gave a proof of the fineness of his nature, equally  
j<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>t towards himself, and conciliating towards the jealo<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. He appeared  
at a tournament on a saddle-cloth, made half of frize and half  
of cloth of gold, and with a motto on each half. One of the mottos  
ran th<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> : — </p>

<lg><l><persName key="Cloth">Cloth</persName> of frize, be not too bold, </l>
<l>- Though thou art match'd with cloth of gold. </l></lg>

<p>The other : </p>

<lg><l><persName key="Cloth">Cloth</persName> of gold, do not despise, </l>
<l>Though thou art match'd with cloth of frize. </l></lg>

<p>It is this beautiful piece of sentiment which puts a heart into his  
history, and makes it worthy remembering. </p>

(<persName key="Daemon">Daemon</persName>) or Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, the <placeName key='Penates'>Penates</placeName>, and the <persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>es. The first was  
supposed to be a spirit allotted to every man from his birth, some say  
with a companion; and that one of them was a suggester of good  
thoughts, and the other of evil. It seems, however, that the Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>;  
was a personification of the conscience, or rather of the prevailing  
impulses of the mind, or the other self of a man; and it was in this  
sense most likely that <persName key="Socrates">Socrates</persName> condescended to speak of his well-

to paint ideas upon the mind in as lively a manner as if in a

<p>Of the belief in an Evil Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, a celebrated example is furnished  
in <persName key="Plutarch">Plutarch</persName>'s account of Brut<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>'s vision, of which <persName key="Shakspeare">Shakspeare</persName> has

kind seem traceable from one superstition to another, and in some  
instances are no doubt immediately so. But fear, and ignorance,  
and even the humility of knowledge are at hand to furnish them,  
where precedent is wanting. There is no doubt however, that the  
<placeName key='Roman'>Roman</placeName>s, who copied and in general vulgarized the Greek mythology,  
took their Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> from the Greek <persName key="Daimon">Daimon</persName> : and as the Greek  
word has survived and taken shape in the common word <persName key="Daemon">Daemon</persName>,  
which by scornful reference to the Heathen religion came at last to  
signify a Devil, so the Latin word Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, not having been <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ed by  
the translators of the Greek Testament, has survived with a better  
meaning, and is employed to express our most genial and intellectual  
faculties. Such and such a man is said to indulge his geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> : — he  
has a geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> for this and that art : — he has a noble geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, an airy  
geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, an original and peculiar geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. <persName key="And">And</persName> as the <placeName key='Roman'>Roman</placeName>s from  
attributing a geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> to every man at his birth, came to attribute one  
to places and to soils, and other more comprehensive peculiarities,  
so we have adopted the same <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e of the term into our poetical  
phraseology. We speak also of the geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, or idiomatic peculiarity,  
of a language. One of the most curio<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> and edifying <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>es of the  
word Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> took place in the English translation of the French  
Arabian Nights, which speaks of o\u' old friends the Genie and the  
Genies. This is nothing more than the French word retained from  
the original translator, who applied the <placeName key='Roman'>Roman</placeName> word Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> to the  
Arabian Dive or Elf. </p>

<p>One of the stories -with which Pa<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>anias has enlivened his  
description of <placeName key='Greece'>Greece</placeName>, is relative to a Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>. He says that one of  
the companions of Ulysses having been killed by the people of  
<persName key="Temesa">Temesa</persName>, they were fated to sacrifice a beautiful virgin every year  
to his manes. They were about to immolate one as <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ual, when  
Euthym<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, a conqueror in the Olympic Games, touched with pity  
at her fate and admiration of her beauty, fell in love with her, and  
resolved to try if he could not put an end to so terrible a c<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>tom.  
He accordingly got permission from the state to marry her, provided  
he could rescue her from her dreadful expectant. He armed himself,  
waited in the temple, ' and the Geni<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> appeared. It was said  
to have been of an appalling presence. It's shape was every way  
formidable, it's colour of an intense black; and it was girded about  
with a wolf-skin. But Euthym<placeName key='us'>us</placeName> fought and conquered it; upon  
which it fled madly, not only beyond the walls, but the utmost  
bounds of <persName key="Temesa">Temesa</persName>, and r<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>hed into the sea. </p>

<p>The <placeName key='Penates'>Penates</placeName> were <persName key="Gods">Gods</persName> of the ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e and family. Collectively  
speaking, they also presided over cities, public roads, aad at last over  
all places with which men were conversant. Their chief government  
however was supposed to be over the most inner and secret part  
of the ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>e, and the subsistence and welfare of it's inmates. They  
were chosen at will out of the number of the gods, as the <placeName key='Roman'>Roman</placeName> in  
modern times chose his favourite saint. In fact, they were only the  
higher gods themselves, descending into a kind of ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ehold familiarity  
They were the personification of a particular <placeName key='Providence'>Providence</placeName>. The

most striking mention of the <placeName key='Penates'>Penates</placeName> which we can call to mind is  
in one of Virgil's most poetical passages. It is where they appear  
to Mneas, to warn him from Crete, and announce his destined  
empire in <placeName key='Italy'>Italy</placeName>.  (Book 3, v. 147.) </p>

I lay, and saw before my very eyes

The great <placeName key='Penates'>Penates</placeName>; whom with reverent joy  
I bore from out the heart of burning <placeName key='Troy'>Troy</placeName>.  
Plainly I saw there, standing in the light

<p>It was no dream : I saw them face to face,  
Their hooded hair; and felt them so before  
My being, that I burst at every pore. </p>

<p>The <persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>es or <persName key="<persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>s"><persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>s</persName>, were the lesser and most familiar ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ehold  
gods; and though their offices were afterwards extended a good deal,  
in the same way as those of the <placeName key='Penates'>Penates</placeName>, with whom they are often  
wrongly confounded, their principal sphere was the fire-place. This  
was in the middle of the room; and the statues of the <persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>es generally  
stood about it in little niches. They are said to have been in the  
shape of monkies; more likely mannikins, or rude little human  
images. Some were made of wax, some of stone, and others doubtless  
of any material for sculpture. They were represented with good-  
natured grinning countenances, were clothed in skins, and had little  
dogs at their feet. Some writers make them the offspring of the  
goddess <placeName key='Mania'>Mania</placeName>, who presided over the spirits of the dead; and  
suppose that originally they were the same as those spirits; which is a  
very probable as well as agreeable superstition, the old nations of  
<placeName key='Italy'>Italy</placeName> having been acc<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>tomed to bury their dead in their ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>es.  
Upon this supposition, the good or "benevolent spirits were called  
Familiar <persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>es, and the evil or malignant ones <persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>vaj and <persName key="Lemures">Lemures</persName>.

by him, and courted by Mercury on the road 3 the consequence of  
which was the birth of the <persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>es. This seems to have a natural  
reference enough to the gossiping over fire-places. </p>

<p>It is impossible not to be struck with the resemblance between  
these lesser ho<placeName key='us'>us</placeName>ehold gods and some of the offices of our old English  
elves and fairies. But of them^ more by and by. Dacier, in a note  
upon <persName key="Horace">Horace</persName> (Book 1, Od. 12.) informs <placeName key='us'>us</placeName>, that in some parts of  
<placeName key='Languedoc'>Languedoc</placeName>, in his time, the fire-place was still called the <persName key="<persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>j"><persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>j</persName> and

ever lived with a sense of the pleasantest parts of the cheerful

the <persName key="Lar">Lar</persName>es. We have not them by <placeName key='us'>us</placeName> at this moment, but we remember
