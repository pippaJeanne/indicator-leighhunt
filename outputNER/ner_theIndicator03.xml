<p>This is the lady, who under the title of <persName key="Godiva">Countess of Coventry</persName>, used  
to make such a figure in our childhood upon some old pocket-pieces  
of that city. We hope she is in great request there still; or the  
inhabitants deserve to be sent from <placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName>. That city used to  
be famous in saintly legends for the visit of the eleven thousand  
virgins, — an "incredible number" saith <persName key="Selden">Selden</persName>. But the eleven  
thousand virgins have vanished with their credibility; and a real  
noble-hearted woman of flesh and blood is <placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName>'s true immortality.</p>

<p>The story of <persName key="Godiva">Godiva</persName> is not a fiction, as many suppose it. At least  
it is to be found in <persName key="Matthew of Westminster">Matthew of Westminster</persName>, and is not of a nature  
to have been a mere invention. Her name, and that of her husband,  
<persName key="Leofric">Leofric</persName>, are mentioned in an old charter recorded by another  
early historian. That the story is omitted by <persName key="Hume">Hume</persName> and others  
argues little against it; for the latter are accustomed to confound  
the most interesting anecdotes of times and manners with something  
below the dignity of history (a very absurd mistake); — and <persName key="Hume">Hume</persName>,  
of whose philosophy better things might have been expected, is  
notoriously less philosophical in his history than in any other of  
his works. A certain coldness of temperament, not unmixed with  
aristocratical pride, or at least with a great aversion from every thing  
like vulgar credulity, rendered his scepticism so extreme, that it  
became in spite of itself a sort of superstition in turn, and blinded  
him to the claims of every species of enthusiasm, civil as well as  
religious. <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName>, with his poetical eyesight, saw better when he  
meditated the history of his native country. We do not remember  
whether he relates the present story; but we remember well, that  
at the beginning of his fragment on that subject, he says he shall  
relate doubtful stories as well as authentic ones, for the benefit of  
those, if no others, who will know how to make use of them,—  
namely, the poets. <note type="hunt" place="foot"> When <persName key="Samuel Johnson">Dr. Johnson</persName>, among his other impatient accusations of our great republican, charged him with telling unwarrantable stories in his history, he must  
haye overlooked this announcement; and yet, if we recollect, it is but in the  
second page of the fragment. So hasty, and blind, and liable to be put to shame  
is prejudice.</note> We have faith however in the story ourselves.</p>

<pb n="18"/>

<p>It has innate evidence enough for us, to give full weight to that of  
the old annalist. Imagination can invent a good deal; affection  
more: but affection can sometimes do things, such as the tenderest  
imagination is at least not in the habit of inventing; and this piece  
of noble-heartedness we believe to have been one of them.</p>

<p><persName key="Leofric">Leofric, Earl of Leicester</persName>, was the lord of a large feudal territory  
in the middle of <placeName key="England" corresp="England">England</placeName>, of which <placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName> formed a part. He  
lived in the time of <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</persName>; and was so eminently a  
feudal lord, that the hereditary greatness of his dominion appears to  
have been singular even at that time, and to have lasted with an  
uninterrupted succession from <persName key="Ethelbald">Ethelbald</persName> to the Conquest, — a period  
of more than three hundred years. He was a great and useful  
opponent of the famous <persName key="Earl Goodwin">Earl Goodwin</persName>.</p>

<p>Whether it was owing to <persName key="Leofric">Leofric</persName> or not, does not appear; but  
<placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName> was subject to a very oppressive tollage, by which it would  
seem that the feudal despot enjoyed the greater part of the profit  
of all marketable commodities. The progress of knowledge has  
shewn us how abominable, and even how unhappy for all parties,  
is an injustice of this description; yet it gives one an extraordinary  
idea of a mind in those times, to see it capable of piercing through  
the clouds of custom, of ignorance, and even of self-interest, and  
petitioning the petty tyrant to forego such a privilege. This mind  
was <persName key="Godiva">Godiva</persName>'s. The other sex, always more slow to admit reason  
through the medium of feeling, were then occupied to the full in  
their warlike habits. It was reserved for a woman to anticipate  
whole ages of liberal opinion, and to surpass them in the daring  
virtue of setting a principle above a custom.</p>

<p>The countess entreated her lord to give up his fancied right; but  
in vain. At last, wishing to put an end to her importunities, he  
told her, either in a spirit of bitter jesting, or with a playful raillery  
that could not be bitter with so sweet an earnestness, that he would  
give up his tax, provided she rode through the city of <placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName>,  
naked. She took him at his word; and said she would. One may  
imagine the astonishment of a fierce unlettered chieftain, not  
untinged with chivalry, at hearing a woman, and that too of the greatest  
delicacy and rank, maintaining seriously her intention of acting  
in a manner contrary to all that was supposed fitting tor her sex,  
and at the same time forcing upon him a sense of the very beauty  
of her conduct by it's principled excess. It is probable, that as he  
could not prevail upon her to give up her design, ixe had sworn  
some religious oath when he made his promise : but be this as it  
may, he took every possible precaution to secure her modesty from  
hurt. The people of <placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName> were ordered to keep within doors, to  
close up all their windows and outlets, and not to give a glance into  
the streets upon pain of death. The day came; and <placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName>, it  
may be imagined, was silent as death. The lady went out at the  
palace door, was set on horseback, and at the same time divested of  
her wrapping garment, as if she had been going into a bath; then  
taking the fillet from her head, she let down her long and lovely  
tresses, which poured around her body like a veil; and so, with only </p>

<pb n="19"/>

<p>her white legs remaining conspicuous, took her gentle way through  
the streets. <note type="hunt" place="foot"> "<q xml:lang="latin">Nuda</q>,"says <persName key="Matthew of Westminster">Matthew of Westminster</persName>, <q xml:lang="latin">"equum ascendens, erines capitis et tricas dissolvens, corpus suum totum, prjeter crura candidissima, inde velavit."</q> See <persName key="Selden">Selden</persName>'s Notes to the <title level="m">Polyolbion</title> of <persName key="Michael Drayton">Drayton</persName>. <title level="s">Song 13</title>. It is <persName key="Selden">Selden</persName> from whom we learn, that <persName key="Leofric">Leofric</persName> was Earl of Leicester, and the other particulars of him mentioned above. <persName key="Leofric">The Earl</persName> was buried at <placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName>, <persName key="Godiva">his Countess</persName> most  
probably, in the same tomb. </note> </p>

<p>What scene can be more touching to the imagination, — beauty,  
modesty, feminine softness, a daring sympathy; an extravagance,  
producing by the nobleness of it's object and the strange gentleness  
of it's means, the grave and profound effect of the most reverend  
custom. We may suppose the scene taking place in the warm noon;  
the doors all shut, the windows closed; <persName key="Leofric">the earl</persName> and his court serious  
and wondering; the other inhabitants, many of them gushing with  
gi-ateful tears, and all reverently listening to hear the footsteps of  
the horse; and lastly, the lady herself, with a downcast but not a  
shamefaced eye, looking towards the earth through her flowing  
locks, and riding through the dumb and deserted streets, like an  
angelic spirit.</p>

<p>It was an honourable superstition in that part of the country, that  
a man who ventured to look at the fair saviour of his native town,  
was struck blind. But the vulgar use to which this superstition has  
been turned by some writers of late times, is not so honourable. The  
whole story is as unvulgar and as sweetly serious, as can be conceived.</p>

<p><persName key="Michael Drayton">Drayton</persName> has not made so much of this subject, as might have been  
expected; yet what he says, is said well and earnestly.</p>

<cit><quote><lg><l><placeName key="Coventry" corresp="England">Coventry</placeName> at length </l>
<l>From her small, mean regard recovered state and strength; </l>
<l>By <persName key="Leofric">Leofric</persName> her lord, yet in base bondage held, </l>
<l>The people from her marts by tollage were expelled; </l>
<l>Whose dutchess which desired this tribute to release. </l>
<l>Their freedom often begged.  The duke, to make her cease. </l>
<l>Told her, that if she would his loss so far enforce. </l>
<l>His will was, she should ride stark naked upon a horse </l>
<l>By daylight through the street : which certainly he thought </l>
<l>In her heroic breast so deeply would have wrought. </l>
<l>That in her former suit she would have left to deal. </l>
<l>But that most princely dame, as one devoured with zeal, </l>
<l>Went on, and by that mean the city clearly freed. </l></lg></quote></cit>

<p>We wonder that none of our painters have yet drawn us <persName key="Godiva">Godiva</persName>  
upon her horse. They can hardly have met with the subject, or  
surely they would have fallen in love with it.</p>

<head type="header">PLEASANT RECOLLECTIONS CONNECTED WITH VARIOUS PARTS OF THE METROPOLIS.</head>

<p>One of the best secrets of enjoyment is the art of cultivating  
pleasant associations. We spoke of this in our first number, and  
shall often have occasion to recur to it. It is an art that of  
necessity increases with the stock of our knowledge; and though in  
acquiring our knowledge we must encounter disagreeable associations
<pb n="20"/>
also, yet if we secure a reasonable quantity of health by the way  
these will be far less in number than the agreeable ones: for unless  
the circumstances which gave rise to the associations, press upon  
us; it is only from want of health that the power of throwing off  
these burdensome images becomes suspended.</p>

<p>And the beauty of this art is, that it does not insist upon pleasant  
materials to work on. Nor indeed does health. Health will give us  
a vague sense of delight, in the midst of objects that would teaze  
and oppress us during sickness. But healthy association peoples this  
vague sense with agreeable images. It will relieve us, even when  
a painful sympathy with the distresses of others becomes a part of  
the very health of our minds. For instance, we can never go  
through <placeName key="St. Giles" corresp="England">St. Giles's</placeName>, but the sense of the extravagant inequalities in  
human condition presses more forcibly upon us; but some pleasant  
images are at hand even there to refresh it. They do not displace  
the others, so as to injure the sense of public duty which they  
excite; they only serve to keep our spirits fresh for their task, and  
hinder them from running into desperation or hopelessness. In  
<placeName key="St. Giles" corresp="England">St. Giles's Church</placeName> lie <persName key="Chapman">Chapman</persName>, the earliest and best translator of  
<persName key="Homer">Homer</persName>; and <persName key="Andrew Marvell">Andrew Marvell</persName>, the wit and patriot, whose poverty  
<persName key="King Charles II">Charles the Second</persName> could not bribe. We are as sure to think of  
these two men, and of all the good and pleasure they have done to  
the world, as of the less happy objects about us. The steeple of the  
church itself too is a handsome one; and there is a flock of pigeons  
in that neighbourhood, which we have stood with great pleasure to  
see careering about it of a fine afternoon, when a western wind had  
swept back the smoke towards the city, and shewed the white of  
the stone steeple piercing up into a blue sky. So much for <placeName key="St. Giles" corresp="England">St.  
Giles's</placeName>, whose very name is a nuisance with some. It is dangerous  
to speak disrespectfully of old districts. Who would suppose  
that <placeName key="the Borough" corresp="England">the Borough</placeName> was the most classical ground in the metropolis?  
And yet it is undoubtedly so. <placeName key="The Globe Theatre" corresp="England">The Globe theatre</placeName> was there, of  
which <persName key="William Shakspeare">Shakspeare</persName> himself was a proprietor, and for which he wrote  
his plays. <placeName key="Globe-Lane" corresp="England">Globe-lane</placeName>, in which it stood, is still extant, we believe,   
under that name. It is probable that he lived near it : it is certain  
that he must have been much there. It is also certain that on <placeName key="the Borough" corresp="England">the  
Borough</placeName> side of the river, then and still called the <placeName key="Bank side" corresp="England">Bank side</placeName>, in the  
same lodging, having the same wardrobe, and some say, with other  
participations more remarkable, lived <persName key="Francis Beaumont">Beaumont</persName> and <persName key="Fletcher">Fletcher</persName>. In  
<placeName key="the Borough" corresp="England">the Borough</placeName> also, at <placeName key="St. Saviour's" corresp="England">St. Saviour's</placeName>, lie <persName key="Fletcher">Fletcher</persName> and <persName key="Massinger">Massinger</persName> in  
one grave; in the same church, under a monument and effigy, lies  
<persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s contemporary, <persName key="Gower">Gower</persName>; and from an inn in <placeName key="the Borough" corresp="England">the Borough</placeName>,  
the existence of which is still boasted, and the scite pointed out by a  
picture and inscription, <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> sets out his pilgrims and himself on  
their famous road to <placeName key="Canterbury" corresp="England">Canterbury</placeName>.</p>

<p>To return over the water, who would expect any thing poetical  
from <placeName key="East Smithfield" corresp="England">East Smithfield</placeName>? Yet there was born the most poetical even  
of poets, <persName key="Edmund Spenser">Spenser</persName>. <persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName> was born within the sound of <placeName key="Bow" corresp="England">Bow</placeName>-bell<note type="editorial"> One is said to be a true cockney (East-Londoner) if one is born within sound range of the Bow Bells</note>, in  
a street no less anti-poetical than <placeName key="Lombard-street" corresp="England">Lombard-street</placeName>. So was <persName key="Gray">Gray</persName>, in  
<placeName key="Cornhill" corresp="England">Cornhill</placeName>.

<p>Her "mate's" heart was buried with lier, and placed upon her  
bosom ! a thing that looks like the fantastic incoherence of a dream.  
It is well we did not know of her presence when at school; or after  
reading one of <persName key="William Shakspeare">Shakspeare</persName>'s tragedies, we should have run twice as  
fast round the cloisters at night time, as we used. <persName key="William Camden">Camden</persName>, "the  
nourrice of antiquitie," received part of his education in this school;  
and here also, not to mention a variety of others known in the  
literary world, were bred two of the most powerful and deep-spirited  
writers of the present day; whose visits to the cloisters we well  
remember.</p>

<p>He was buried in the workhouse in <placeName key="Shoe Lane" corresp="England">Shoe Lane</placeName>; — a circumstance, at

<p>But a line or two, a single sentence in an author of former times,
