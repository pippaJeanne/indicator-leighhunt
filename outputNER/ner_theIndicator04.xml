<p>There was a man of the name of <persName key="Kennedy" cert="unknown" ref="#" type="real" xml:id="kennedy">Kennedy</persName>, who was well known  
to people of fashion in our childhood, but with whose origin, preterisions  
or way of living, nobody was acquainted. That he was rich  
was certain, for he wore the most precious stones on his fingers, and  
was known to keep a great deal of money at a banker's. He was  
evidently very fond of the upper circles, and for some time was  
admitted into their parties. He was now and then at the opera;  
oftener at routs and balls; and always went to court, when he could  
get there. </p>

<p>We have heard him described. He was a very spare man, not  
much above thirty, of the middle height, with eyes a little shut and  
lowering, a small nose, and a very long chin. But he dressed  
extremely well; had a softness of manners amounting to the timid;  
and paid exceeding homage to every person and thing of any fashionable  
repute.</p>

<p>All this, for some tirtie, procured him a good reception; but at last,   
people began to wonder that though he got invitations from every  
body, he gave none himself. It was not even known that her ever  
fidade a present, or had a person home with him even to a luncheon  
or a cup of tea. Twice he gave a great dinner, at which it was  
owned that there was a profusion of every thing; but though it was  
not at a tavern, it was not at his own place of abode; and the people  
of the house knew nothing about him. </p>

<p>All this gave rise to a suspicion, that he was a miser; and people  
soon contrived to have pretty strong proofs of it. In vain the least  
bashful of his acquaintances admired the beauty of his numerous  
rings; in vain others applied to him for loans of money, some by  
way of trial and others from necessity; in vain his movements  
were watched by the more idle and gossiping; in vain hints were  
thrown out and questions asked, and his very footsteps pursued.  
His rings were all keepsakes -, he always had no money <hi rend="italics">just then</hi>;  

<pb n="26"/>

he referred for his lodgings to an hotel, where he occasionally put  
up, perhaps for that very purpose; and a curious fellow, who  
endeavoured to follow him home one night, was led such an enormous  
round through street after street, and even suburb after suburb, that  
he gave up the point with an oath. </p>

<p>After this, his acquaintance grew more and more shy of him:  
they gradually left off inviting him to their houses, some from  
mercenary disappointment, some from a more generous disgust, others  
because the rest did so; and at last, just after a singular adventure  
which happened to him at <placeName type="city" key="Brighton" corresp="England" cert="high" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q131491">Brighton</placeName>, he totally disappeared. </p>

<p>Every body took him for a madman on that occasion. He had  
not been at the place above a day or two, and was seen, during  
that time, walking about the beach very thoughtfully, with an air  
of sorrow, owing, it was conjectured, to his having put himself to  
the expense of travelling without obtaining his expected repayment,  
for nobody invited him. But be this as it may, he was  
seen, one morning, running in the most violent manner across <placeName type="street" key="Old Steine" corresp="England" cert="high" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15263862">the  
Steyne</placeName>, and crying out <q type="spoken">Fire !</q> His face was as pale as death; he  
seemed every now and then, in the midst of his haste, to be twitched  
and writhed up with a sort of convulsion; and his hat having been  
blown off by the wind, no wonder he was thought seized with a  
frenzy. Yet when he arrived at his lodging, there was no fire, nor  
even a symptom of it. </p>

<p>The suspicion of his being out of his wits, was rendered still  
stronger by a rumour which took place the same day; for the servants  
of the family which he used to visit most, and in which he was  
paying his addresses to a young lady, declared that not many minutes  
after the uproar about the fire, he came to their master's house,  
through the by-ways, with a coal-heaver's hat on. And the assertion  
was confirmed by some tradesmen who had seen him pass, and by  
some boys who had followed him with shouts and nick-names. </p>

<p>The mystery supplied the world with talk for more than a week,  
when at length it was explained through the family we have just  
mentioned. <persName key="Charles Kennedy">Kennedy</persName>, it seems, was really a miser, and had inherited  
the estates of a third or fourth cousin, whose name he took. He had  
had little or no acquaintance with his kinsman, before he found  
himself his heir. His father was a petty overseer somewhere or other,  
at a great distance from <placeName type="city" key="London" corresp="England" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84">London</placeName> and the cousin, whose estates he  
succeeded to, was the son of a general officer in the <orgName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" generatedBy="human" instant="unknown" xml:space="default" corresp="India" key="East India Company" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/East_India_Company">East-India</orgName>  
service. The cousin had had a son whom he sent abroad to follow  
his grandfather's profession; but receiving the news of his death a  
little before his own, he sickened the faster, and being in a state  
of great weakness and despondency, left his estates to his next heir,  
without having much heart to inquire what sort of person he was.  
The fortunate young overseer quitted his shop immediately, and  
coming up to town had occasion to wait on a young lady, to whom  
his cousin's son had been attached. It was to give her a lock of her  
lover's hair, and a gold watch, which his father sent her with it in  
token of his own regard for her. A little note acconipanied them,  

<pb n="27"/>

which she shewed one day with the tears in her eyes; though she was  
then happy enough : — </p>

<cit><quote><p>I leave you no money, my dear child; I am dying, and you are  
wealthy enough, and money is not the thing wanted by either of us.  
Just before I received the news of my poor boy's death, he sent me  
this lock of his hair for you, to shew you how glossy and healthy ---

Excuse me, my love; — the tears blot out what I was going to write;  
and so they ought. But I know well enough that the kind-hearted  
generous girl who was worthy of him, will think I pay her a greater  
compliment in leaving her only what belonged to her <persName key="Charles">Charles</persName>, than  
if I had sent her all the money which he never possessed. The next  
heir, I am told, is a good young man, and he is poor, with a number  
of poor relations. The watch was <persName key="Charles">Charles</persName>'s, when a boy. My father  
gave it me, and I to him, and he used to say that he would  
God in heaven bless you, my poor, sweet girl, prays your old  
<hi rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName key="Charles Kennedy" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Kennedy_(diplomat)" cert="medium" type="real">Charles Kennedy</persName>."</hi></hi> </p></quote></cit>

<p>The consequence of the new heir's visiting <persName key="Miss Cameron">Miss Cameron</persName>, was his  
falling in love with her; if such a miser as he turned out to be,  
could be said to fall in love. But though she could not help pitying  
him at first, as she afterwards said, it was only on account of his  
strange habits, which she soon detected, and which she foresaw would  
make him ridiculous and unhappy wherever he went. He soon tired  
and disgusted her. After a very unequivocal repulse one day, which  
seemed to make him prodigiously thoughtful and unhappy, he came  
in the evening, with a mixture of odd triumph and uneasiness in his   
aspect, at which <persName key="Miss Cameron">Miss Cameron</persName> said she could hardly forbear  
laughing, even from a feeling of bitterness. She saw that he  
expected to make an impression on her of some sort; and so he did;  
for taking an opportunity of speaking with her alone, he drew out of  
his waistcoat pocket, with much anxiety, the first present his wealth  
had ever made her, — a fine diamond pin. A very fine one she confest  
it was. It was clear that he thought this irresistible; and nothing  
could exceed his surprise when she refused him peremptorily once  
more, and the pin with him. She owned that her sense of the ridiculous  
so far surmounted her other feelings, as to give her a passing  
inclination to accept the diamond, as she knew very well that he had  
reckoned on its returning to him by marriage. But her contempt  
recovered itself; and her disgust and scorn were completed by his  
mentioning the words <q type="mentioned">Mrs. Kennedy,</q> which brought so noble  
and lamented a contrast before her, and visited her so fiercely with  
a sense of what she had lost, that she quitted the room with a sort  
of breathless and passionate murmur. </p>

<p>This was but the day before the adventure of the fire. She was  
almost inclined on the latter occasion to think him mad, as others  
did, especially when he once naore appeared before her, shuffling in  
a most ludicrous manner with something in his hand which he wished  
to conceal, and which she found afterwards was the hat. He would  

<pb n="28"/>

not have ventured to appear before her again; but the truth was  
that her father, who was but an ordinary sort of monied man, and  
not very delicate, did not interfere as he ought, to prevent her being  
thus persecuted. But not only was the mystery explained to her  
next day: it was the most important one of both their lives. </p>

<p>On the morning when <persName key="Charles Kennedy">Kennedy</persName> was frightened by the fire, he was  
standing very thoughtfully by <placeName type="building" key="The Ship Inn" corresp="England" cert="high" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26563318">the Ship Inn</placeName>, near the sea-side, when  
he was suddenly clapped by somebody on the shoulder. He turned  
round with a start, and saw a face which he knew well enough. It  
was that of a gentleman who, riding once when a youth, by the place  
where he lived, had saved him from drowning in a little piece of  
water. Some mischievous companions had hustled him into it, not  
knowing how far their malicious joke might have gone. When he  
was pulled out and had recovered from his first fright, he thanked  
the young gentleman in as warm a way as he could express; and  
taking fourpence-halfpenny out of a little leathern bag, offered it  
him as a proof of his gratitude. The young gentleman declining it  
with a good-natured smile, thinking the offer to be the effect of  
mere simplicity ; but the lads who were looking on, and who had  
helped to get him out when told of the danger, burst out into taunting  
reproaches of the fellow's meanness, and informed his preserver  
that he had at least three shillings in the other fob of his leathern  
bag, besides silver pennies. So saying, they wrenched it out of his  
hands in spite of his crying and roaring ; and one of them opening  
it, shook out, together with the water, five shillings in sixpences,  
and the silver pennies to boot. The young gentleman laughed and  
blushed at the same instant, and not knowing well what to do, for  
he longed to give the young miser a lesson, and yet thought it would  
be unjust to share the money between the lads who had nearly  
drowned him, said to him, <q type="spoken">I am not the only one to whom you  
are indebted for being saved, for it was the screams of those little  
girls there which brought me to you, and so you know,</q> continued  
he, with a laugh which the others joined,  <q type="spoken">they ought to be rewarded  
as well as myself. Don't you think so?</q> <q type="spoken">Yes, Sir,</q>  
mumbled the young hunks, half frightened, and half sulky. The  
young gentleman then divided all the silver but a shilling among  
the little girls, who dropped him a hundred curtsies; and giving the  
fourpence-halfpenny to the boy who had been most forward in helping, 
and least noisy in accusing, rode off amidst the shouts, of the rest, </p>

<p>It was the first time the two had met since. <q type="spoken">I believe,</q> said  
the stranger, with a sort of smile, <q type="spoken">I have had the honour of meeting  
you before?</q> <q type="spoken">The same. Sir,</q> answered the other, <q type="spoken">at your  
service. I believe. Sir, — I think, — I am sure.</q> <q type="spoken">Yes, Sir,</q>  
returned the stranger, <q type="spoken">it was I who played you that trick with your  
bag of sixpences</q> — <q type="spoken">Oh, dear Sir,</q> rejoined the other, half  
ashamed at the recollection, and admiring the fashionable air of his  
preserver, <q type="spoken">I am sure I had no reason to complain. Been abroad,  
Sir, I presume, by a certain brownness of complexion, not at all   
unbecoming?</q>  <q type="spoken">Yes, Sir,</q> said the gentleman, smiling more and  

<pb n="29"/> 

more : <q type="spoken">I hope you have been as lucky at home, as some of us who  
go abroad?</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Why, yes. Sir; — I have a pretty fortune, thank heaven, though  
at present — just now — </q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Oh, my dear Sir,</q> interrupted the stranger, with a peculiar  
sort of look, in which animal spirits and a sense of the ridiculous  
seemed predominant — <q type="spoken">I can wait — I can wait.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Can wait. Sir?</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Yes, Sir, I know what you mean : you have a sort of liberal  
yearning, which incites you to make me an acknowledgment for  
the little piece of service I was enabled to render you. But I am  
not poor, Sir; and indeed should decline such a thing from any but  
a man of fortune, and upon any other score than that of relieving his own feelings; so that I can very easily wait, you know, for  
an opportunity more convenient to you; when I shall certainly not  
hesitate to accept a trifle or so, — a brilliant — or a diamond seal,— or  
any little thing of that sort.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Bless me, Sir, you are very good. But you see. Sir, you — you —  
see — I am very sorry. Sir, but no doubt — in the fashionable circles,  
—but at present, I have an engagement.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Ah, Sir,</q> said the stranger with a careless air, and giving him  
a thump on the shoulder which made him jump — <q type="spoken">pray do not let  
me interrupt you. I only hope you are not lodging in — in — what's  
the name of the street?</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken"><placeName type="street" key="North Street" corresp="England" cert="medium" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26660808">North Street</placeName>? — I tried <placeName type="street" key="the Steyne" corresp="England">the Steyne</placeName>, but—</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Ah, <placeName type="street" key="North Street" corresp="England">North Street</placeName>.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Why so. Sir, pray?</q> asked the other, with an air of increasing  
fidget and alarm, and looking about him. </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Why, Sir, an accident has just happened there.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">An accident ! Oh my dear Sir, you know those sort of things  
cannot be helped.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">No, Sir, but it's a very awkward sort of accident, and the  
lodger, I understand, is from home.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">How, Sir, — what lodger, — what accident, what is it you mean,  
dear Sir?</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">Why, look there, my good friend — look there ;— there they are,  
removing them — removing the goods : — a fire has broken out.</q> </p>

<p><persName key="Charles Kennedy">Kennedy</persName> seemed petrified. There was a great crowd in the street  
to which the stranger pointed, occasioned by a scuffle with a puppet-show 
man. The boys were shouting, and the little moveable Punch  
theatre tumbled about in the top of the fray, looking in the distance,  
like a piece of a bedstead, or some other sort of goods. </p>

<p><q type="spoken">There they are —</q> continued the stranger, <q type="spoken">now they take away  
the bedstead, — now they bring the engines, — now they are conveying  
out something else, — the smoke — don't you see the smoke !</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">O lord, I do, I do,</q> exclaimed the miser, who saw nothing but  
his own imagination, and his boxes of brilliants carried off. He  
turned deadly pale, then red, then pale again, and seeming to summon  

<pb n="30"/>

up a convulsive strength, sprang off witb all his mighty and  
rushed across <placeName type="street" key="the Steyne" corresp="England">the Steyne</placeName> like a madman. </p>

<p>When he arrived at his lodging he found the street empty, and the  
house quite cool, and being anxious to make the best and quickest of  
his story with his mistress and her father, went there as instantly as  
possible : but first, in a great hurry, he borrowed a hat of his landlord,  
who half in haste also, and half in joke, gave him one of his coalmeter's,  
which he unconsciously put on. </p>

<p>Scarcely had he astonished the young lady, and set his foot again  
out of doors, than he encountered the stranger who had played him  
the joke. His first impulse was to be very angry, but he wanted  
courage to complain ; and recollecting his first adventure with his  
preserver, would have passed by under pretence of not seeing him.  
He was stopped however by the elbow. <q type="spoken">My dear Sir,</q> exclaimed  
the stranger with his old smile, <q type="spoken">I rejoice to find that all was safe.</q>  
<q type="spoken">Pray</q> continued he, changing his aspect, and looking grave and  
earnest, — <q type="spoken">You know the various families at <placeName type="city" key="Brighton" corresp="England">Brighton</placeName> ; — I have  
found just now that there is one here which will save me a journey  
to <placeName type="city" key="London" corresp="England">London</placeName> — the name is Cameron — can you tell me where they live?  
There is a person of the name of <persName key="Kennedy">Kennedy</persName> also, who I understand is  
here too; — but that doesn't signify at present; — pray tell me if you  
know where the <persName key="Cameron">Camerons</persName> are.</q> </p>

<p><q type="spoken">There, there, sir,</q> answered the other, almost frightened out of  
his wits, and anxious to get away; — <q type="spoken">there, two or three doors off.</q> </p>

<p>The stranger dropped his arm in an instant, and in an instant  
knocked at the door. With almost as much speed poor <persName key="Charles Kennedy">Kennedy</persName>  
returned to his lodging. We know not what he was thinking about;  
but he surprised the landlord with his exceeding hurry to be  
gone; and gone he would have been much sooner than he was, if it  
had not been for a dispute about a bill, which he was in the midst of  
contesting, when a footman came from the <persName key="Cameron">Camerons</persName>, requesting his  
presence immediately upon important business. </p>

<p>The poor miser's mortifications were not to cease by the way. The  
footman, upon being admitted to him, turned out to be the same  
person who was riding as a foot-boy behind the young gentleman,  
when the latter came up to help him out of the water. <q type="spoken">Good God,  
sir,</q> says the man, who had something of his master's look about him,  
<q type="spoken">I beg your pardon, — but are you the <persName key="Kennedy" ref="#kennedy" type="real">Mr. Kennedy</persName> who has got  
my master's fortune?</q> The other had been agitated already ; but  
the whole truth seemed now to come upon him as fast, as if it would  
squeeze the breath out of his hody; and muttering a few indistinct  
words, he motioned to the footman that he would go with him. He  
then looked about in a bewildered manner for his hat, and taking up  
the coal-heaver's, which in spite of some other feelings, made the  
footman turn aside to hold his own to his mouth, he dropped it down  
again, and turning as pale as a sheet, fell back into a chair. </p>

<p>The footman, after administering a glass of water, called up the  
landlord; and begging him, in a respectful manner, to take care of the  

<pb n="31"/>

gentleman, to whom he would fetch his master, hastened back to  
inform the latter, who, comparing the accounts of his old acquaintance  
with the <persName key="Cameron">Camerons</persName>, had already guessed the secret, to the great  
wondering of all parties. </p>

<p>You have doubtless been guessing with him ; and it is easy to fancy  
the remainder. There had been a false return of the young soldier's  
death, in accounts from the army in <placeName type="country" key="India" corresp="India" cert="high" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q668">India</placeName>. He had been taken  
prisoner, and when he obtained his liberty, learnt with great grief and  
surprise, that his father had died under the impression that he was  
dead also, and had left his property to unknown heirs. The property  
would have been a very secondary thing, in his mind, for its own sake;  
and he was aware he could regain it; but his father's death afflicted  
him much, particularly under all the circumstances; and he felt so  
much anguish at the thought of what <persName key="Miss Cameron">Miss Cameron</persName> must suffer, to  
whom he had plighted his faith but two years before, that it was with  
difficulty he held up against grief, and hurry, and a burning climate,  
so as not to fall into an illness; the very fear of which, and the delay  
that it would cause, was almost enough to produce it. Not to  
mention that it was possible his mistress believing him dead, might too  
quickly enter into engagements with another, though he did not  
suppose it very likely. But we need not dwell upon these matters. He  
found his mistress the same as ever; shed sweet bitter tears with  
her, for his father, his own supposed loss, and her grieving constancy;  
and regaining his fortune, settled an income upon the poor miser,  
which the latter, remembering the adventure of the drowning, could  
hardly believe possible. </p>

<p>TOLERATION. </p>


<p>The world has afforded some melancholy examples of great and  
good minds rendered intolerant by mistaking dogmas for religion :  
but in general, a man's intolerance is in proportion to his want of  
wisdom and natural kindness. It is only an extreme evidence, from  
whatever cause arising, of the inability to bear an argument; whether  
from conscious tendency to doubt, and want of candour or courage to  
acknowledge it; or from a fierce egotism too proud to be differed  
with ; or from the callousness of mere worldly supereminence, ready  
to trample down every thing that endangers it's authority, or shames  
it with it's truth ; or lastly, from fright and imbecility, which  
confound mere custom with every species of security and good. Ordinary  
intolerance generally arises from the first or the last of these causes.  
<persName key="Samuel Johnson">Dr. Johnson</persName>, who longed to repose in the bosom of an infallible  
ehurch, was intolerant from the united influence of doubt rendered  
melancholy by disease. But his intolerance lay chiefly in discourse.  
He had a great deal of real charity and goodness, with all his  
dictatorial manners. <persName key="King Henry VIII">Henry the 8th</persName> was intolerant from a ferocious  
self-love, changing his own opinion as he pleased, and then calling  
on others to obey the new ones as they had done the old. Lastly,  
such a man as <persName key="Bonner">Bonner</persName> appears to have been intolerant from sheer  
hard-hearted worldliness, mixed perhaps with an impious belief that  
the <persName type="fictional" key="God">Supreme Being</persName> was a tyrant after the fashion of worldly tyrants,  
and was to be so served and made court to. But toleration has been  
gradually increasing with the strength of opinion and the press. It  
is pressed upon with less hardness at every fresh use of the foot  
of authority, however foolish and uncharitable even that pressure  
may be. And the last and best proof of it's increase (a proof, which  
ought to shame all it's enemies) is, that intolerance itself is treated  
with candour. </p></div3>
