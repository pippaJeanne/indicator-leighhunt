                    <p>There  is  a  bird  in  the  interior  of  <placeName type="continent" key="Africa" corresp="Africa">Africa</placeName>,  whose  habits  would  rather  seem  to  belong  to  the  interior

                         of  wild bees  are  to  be  found.  It  calls  them  with  a  cheerful  cry,  which  they  answer;  and  on  finding  itself  
                         recognized, flies  and  hovers  over  a  hollow  tree  containing  the  honey.  While  they  are  occupied  in  
                         collecting  it,  the  bird goes  to  a  little  distance,  where  he  observes  all  that  passes;  and  the  hunters,  
                         when  they  have  helped  themselves, take  care  to  leave  him  his  portion  of  the  food. — This  is  the

                    <p>It is a curious and pleasant thing to consider, that a link of personal  
acquaintance can be traced up from the authors of our own  
times to those of <persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName>, and to <persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName> himself. <persName key="Ovid">Ovid</persName>, in  
recording with fondness his intimacy with <persName key="Propertius">Propertius</persName> and <persName key="Horace">Horace</persName>,  
regrets that he had only seen <persName key="Virgil">Virgil</persName>. <note type="hunt">(Trist. Book 4. v. 51.)</note> But  
still he thinks the sight of him worth remembering. -And <persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName>, when  
a child, prevailed on some friends to take him to a coffee house which  
<persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> frequented, merely to look at him; which he did, to his  
great satisfaction. Now such of us as have shaken hands with a  
living poet, might be able perhaps to reckon up a series of connecting  
shakes to the very hand that wrote of <persName type="fictional" key="Hamlet">Hamlet</persName>, and of <persName type="fictional" key="Sir John Falstaff">Falstaff</persName>,  
and of <persName type="fictional" key="Desdemona">Desdemona</persName>. </p>

<p>With some living poets, it is certain. There is <persName key="Thomas Moore">Thomas Moore</persName>,  
for instance, who knew <persName key="Sheridan">Sheridan</persName>. <persName key="Sheridan">Sheridan</persName> knew <persName key="Samuel Johnson" cert="low">Johnson</persName>, who  
was the friend of <persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName>, who knew <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Steele</persName>, who knew <persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName>. <persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName>  
was intimate with <persName key="Congreve">Congreve</persName>, and <persName key="Congreve">Congreve</persName> with <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName>. <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName>  
is said to have visited <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName>. <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName> is said to have known  
<persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName>; and to have been saved by him from the revenge of the  
restored court, in return for having saved <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName> from the revenge  
of the Commonwealth. But if the link between <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> and <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName>,  
and <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName> and <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName> is somewhat apocryphal, or rather dependent  
on tradition (for <persName key="Richardson">Richardson</persName> the painter tells us the latter from  
<persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName>, who had it from <persName key="Betterton">Betterton</persName> the actor, one of <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName>'s  
company), it may be carried at once from <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> to <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName>, with  
whom he was unquestionably intimate. <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName> then knew <persName key="Hobbes">Hobbes</persName>,  
who knew <persName key="Francis Bacon">Bacon</persName>, who knew <persName key="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</persName>, who was intimate with  
<persName key="Francis Beaumont">Beaumont</persName> and <persName key="Fletcher">Fletcher</persName>, <persName key="Chapman">Chapman</persName>, <persName key="Donne">Donne</persName>, <persName key="Michael Drayton">Drayton</persName>, <persName key="William Camden">Camden</persName>, <persName key="Selden">Selden</persName>.  
<persName key="Clarendon">Clarendon</persName>, <persName key="Sir Philip Sidney">Sydney</persName>, <persName key="Raleigh">Raleigh</persName>, and perhaps all the great men of  
<persName key="Queen Elizabeth I">Elizabeth</persName>'s and <persName key="King James I">James</persName>'s time, the greatest of them all undoubtedly.  
Thus have we a link of <q type="soCalled">beamy hands</q> from our own times up to  
<persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName>. </p>

<pb n="42"/>

<p>In this friendly genealogy we have omitted the numerous sidebranches,  
or common friendships; but of those we shall give an  
account by and by. It may be mentioned however, in order not to  
omit <persName key="Edmund Spenser">Spenser</persName>, that <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName> resided some time in the family of  
<persName key="Sir Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke">Sir Fulke Greville Lord Brooke</persName>, the Friend of <persName key="Sir Philip Sidney">Sir Philip Sydney</persName>.  
<persName key="Edmund Spenser">Spenser</persName>'s intimacy with <persName key="Sir Philip Sidney">Sydney</persName> is mentioned by himself, in a letter,  
still extant, to <persName key="Gabriel Harvey">Gabriel Harvey</persName>. </p>

<p>We will now give the authorities for our intellectual pedigree.  
<persName key="Sheridan">Sheridan</persName> is mentioned in <persName key="James Boswell">Boswell</persName> as being admitted to the  
celebrated club, of which <persName key="Samuel Johnson" cert="low">Johnson</persName>, <persName key="Goldsmith">Goldsmith</persName>, and others were members.  
He had then, if we remember, just written his <title level="a">School for Scandal</title>,  
which made him the more welcome. Of <persName key="Samuel Johnson" cert="low">Johnson</persName>'s friendship with  
<persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName> (we cannot help beginning the sentence with his favourite  
leading preposition), the well-known Life is an interesting and  
honourable record. It is said that in the commencement of their  
friendship, they have sometimes wandered together about <placeName type="city" key="London" corresp="England">London</placeName> for  
want of a lodging; — more likely, for <persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName>'s want of it, and <persName key="Samuel Johnson" cert="low">Johnson</persName>'s  
fear of offending him by offering a share of his own- But we  
do not- remember how this circumstance is related by <persName key="James Boswell">Boswell</persName>. </p>

<p><persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName>'s intimacy with <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Steele</persName> is recorded in a pleasant anecdote,  
which he told <persName key="Samuel Johnson" cert="high">Johnson</persName>. <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName> once desired him, <q type="written">with an  
air of the utmost importance,</q> says <persName key="Samuel Johnson">his biographer</persName>, <q type="written">to come very  
early to his house the next morning. <persName key="Richard Savage">Mr. Savage</persName> came as he had  
promised, found the chariot at the door, and <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName> waiting for  
him, and ready to go out. What was intended, and whither they  
were to go. <persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName> could not conjecture, and was not willing to  
enquire; but immediately seated himself with <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName>. The  
coachman was ordered to drive, and they hurried with the utmost  
expedition to <placeName type="landmark" key="Hyde-Park Corner" corresp="England">Hyde-Park Corner</placeName>, where they stopped at a petty  
tavern, and retired to a private room. <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName> then informed  
him that he intended to publish a pamphlet, and that he had desired  
him to come thither that he might write for him. They soon sat  
down to the work. <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName> dictated, and <persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName> wrote, till the  
dinner that had been ordered was put upon the table. <persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName> was  
surprised at the meanness of the entertainment, and after some hesi-  
tation ventured to ask for wine, which <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName>, not without  
reluctance, ordered to be brought. They then finished their dinner,  
and proceeded in their pamphlet, which they concluded in the  
afternoon.</q> </p>

<p><q type="written"><persName key="Richard Savage">Mr. Savage</persName> then imagined that his task was over, and expected  
that <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName> would call for the reckoning, and return home;  
but his expectations deceived him, for <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName> told him that he  
was without money, and that the pamphlet must be sold before the  
dinner could be paid for, and <persName key="Richard Savage">Savage</persName> was therefore obliged to go and  
offer their new jiroduction for sale for two guineas, which with some  
difficulty he obtained. <persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Sir Richard</persName> then returned home, having  
retired that day only to avoid his creditors, and composed the  
pamphlet only to discharge his reckoning.</q><note type="source"><bibl><author>Samuel Johnson</author><title level="m">The Life of Mr. Richard Savage, Son of the Earl Rivers</title></bibl></note></p> 

<p><persName key="Sir Richard Steele">Steele</persName>'s acquaintance with <persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName>, who wrote some papers for his  

<pb n="43"/>

Guardian, appears in the letters and other works of the wits of that  
time. <persName key="Samuel Johnson" cert="low">Johnson</persName> supposes that it was his friendly interference, which  
attempted to bring <persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName> and <persName key="Addison">Addison</persName> together after a jealous separation.  
<persName key="Alexander Pope">Pope</persName>'s friendship with <persName key="Congreve">Congreve</persName> appears also in his letters.  
He also dedicated the <title level="m">Iliad</title> to him, over the heads of peers and  
patrons. <persName key="Congreve">Congreve</persName>, whose conversation most likely partook of the  
elegance and wit of his writings, and whose manners appear to have  
rendered him an universal favourite, had the honour in his youth of  
attracting singular respect and regard from <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName>. He was publicly  
hailed by him as his successor, and affectionately bequeathed the  
care of his laurels. <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> did not know who had been looking at  
him in the coffee-house. </p>

<cit><quote><lg><l>Already I am worn with cares and age, </l>
<l>And just abandoning th' ungrateful stage; </l>

<l>But you, whom every Muse and Grace adorn. </l>

</bibl></note></cit>

<p><persName key="Congreve">Congreve</persName> did so with great tenderness. </p>

<p><persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> is reported to have asked <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName>'s permission to turn his  
<title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> into a rhyming tragedy, which he called <title level="u">the State of  
Innocence</title>, or <title level="u">the Fall of Man</title>, a work, such as might be expected  
from such a mode of alteration. The venerable poet is said to have  
answered, <q>Ay, young man, you may tag my verses, if you will.</q>  
Be the connection, however, of <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> vdth <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName>, or of <persName key="Milton">Milton</persName>  
with <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName> as it may, <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> wrote the alteration of <persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName>'s  
<title level="m">Tempest</title>, as it is now perpetrated, in conjunction with <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName>.  
They were great hands, but they should not have touched the pure  
grandeur of <persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName>. The intimacy of <persName key="Sir William Davenant">Davenant</persName> with <persName key="Hobbes">Hobbes</persName> is  
to be seen by their correspondence prefixed to <persName key="Gondibert">Gondibert</persName>. <persName key="Hobbes">Hobbes</persName>  
was at one time secretary to <persName key="Francis Bacon">Lord Bacon</persName>, a singularly illustrious  
instance of servant and master. <persName key="Francis Bacon">Bacon</persName> is also supposed to have had  
<persName key="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</persName> for a retainer in some capacity; but it is certain that  
<persName key="Ben Jonson">Jonson</persName> had his acquaintance, for he records it in his <title level="s">Discoveries</title>.  
And had it been otherwise, his link with the preceding writers could  
be easily supplied through the medium of <persName key="Greville">Greville</persName> and <persName key="Sir Philip Sidney">Sydney</persName>, and  
indeed of many others of his contemporaries. Here then we arrive  
at <persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName>, and feel the electric virtue of his hand. Their  
intimacy, dashed a little, perhaps, with jealousy on the part of <persName key="Ben Jonson">Jonson</persName>,  
but maintained to the last by dint of the nobler part of him and of  
<persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName>'s irresistible fineness of nature, is a thing as notorious as  
their fame. <persName key="Thomas Fuller">Fuller</persName> says, <q type="written"> Many were the wit-combates betwixt  
(<persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName>) and <persName key="Ben Jonson">Ben <choice><corr>Jonson</corr><sic>Johnson</sic></choice></persName>, which two I behold like a Spanish  
great gallion and an English man of war : <persName key="Ben Jonson">Master <choice><corr>Jonson</corr><sic>Johnson</sic></choice></persName> (like the  
former) was built far higher in learning : solid, but slow in his   
performances. <persName key="William Shakespeare">Shakspeare</persName> with the English man of war, lesser in bulk.

advantage of all winds, by the quickness of his wit and invention.</q><note type="source"><bibl><author>Thomas Fuller</author><title>The history of the worthies of England</title></bibl></note> 
This is a happy simile, with the exception of what is insinuated about  
<persName key="Ben Jonson">Jonson</persName>'s greater solidity. But let <persName key="Ben Jonson">Jonson</persName> shew for himself the  
affection, with which he regarded one, who did not irritate or trample  
down rivalry but rose above it like the quiet and all-gladdening sun,   
and turned emulation to worship. </p>

<head type="header">ANGLING. </head>


<p>The anglers are a race of men who puzzle us. We do not  
mean for their patience, which is laudable; nor for the infinite non-  
success of some of them, which is desirable. Neither do we agree  
with the good joke attributed to <persName key="Jonathan Swift">Swift</persName>, that angling is always to be  
considered as <q type="written">a stick and a string, with a fly at one end and a fool   
at the other.</q><note type="editorial">A version of this "a stick and a string, with a worm at one end and a fool at the other" is attributed in Instructions to Young Sportsmen (1824) by Colonel Peter Hawker. <ref target="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson"/></note> Nay, if he had books with him and a pleasant day,  
we can even account for the joyousness of that prince of all punters,  
who having been seen in the same identical spot one morning and  
evening, and asked both times whether he had had any success, said  
No; but in the course of the day, he had had <q>a glorious nibble.</q> </p>

<p>But the anglers boast of the innocence of their pastime; yet it  
puts fellow-creatures to the torture. They pique themselves on their  
meditative faculties and yet their only excuse is a want of thought.  
It is this that puzzles us. Old <persName key="Izaak Walton">Isaac Walton</persName>, their patriarch, speaking  
of his inquisitorial abstractions on the banks of a river, says. </p>

a ball or a concert, it is <q type="emph">to be lamented.</q> To put pleasure into  
the faces of half a dozen agreeable women, is a toy unworthy of the  
manliness of a worm-sticker. But to put a hook into the gills of a  
carp, — there you attain the end of a reasonable being; there you  
shew yourself truly a lord of the creation. To plant your feet  
occasionally in the mud, is also a pleasing step. So is cutting your  
ancles with weeds and stones. </p>

<p>The book of <persName key="Izaak Walton">Isaac Walton</persName> upon angling is undoubtedly a delightful  
performance in some respects. It smells of the country air,   
and of the flowers in cottage windows. Its pictures of rural scenery,  
its simplicity, its snatches of old songs, are all good and refreshing;  
and his prodigious rehshof a dressed fish would not be grudged him,  
if he had killed it a little more decently. He really seems to have a  
respect for a piece of salmon; to approach it, like the grace, with  
his hat off. But what are we to think of a man, who in the midst of  
his tortui'es of other animals, is always valuing himself on his  
wonderful harmlessness; and who actually follows up one of his most  
complacent passages of this kind with an injunction to impale a  
certain worm tmce upon the hook, because it is lively, and might get  
off? All that can be said of such an extraordinary inconsistency is,  
that having been bred up in an opinion of the innocence of his  
amusement, and possessing a healthy power of exercising voluntary  
thoughts (as far as he had any), he must have dozed over the  
opposite side of the question, so as to become almost, perhaps quite  
insensible to it. And angling does indeed seem the next thing to  
dreaming. It dispenses with loco-motion, reconciles contradictions,  
and renders the very countenance null and void. A friend of ours,  
who is an admirer of <persName key="Izaak Walton">Walton</persName>, was struck, just as we were, with the  
likeness of the old angler's face to a fish. It is hard, angular, and of

<persName key="Charles Cotton">Cotton</persName>'s pleasures had not been confined to fishing.  
His sympathies indeed had been a little superabundant, and left  
him perhaps not so great a power of thinking as he pleased.  
Accordingly, we find more symptoms of scrupulousness upon the  
subject of angling in his writings, than in those of his father. </p>

<p><persName key="Izaak Walton">Walton</persName> says, that an angler does no hurt but to fish; and this he

<p>This argument, and another about fish's being made for <q type="soCalled">man's  
pleasure and diet,</q> are all that anglers have to say for the  
innocence of their sport. But they are both as rank sophistications as  
can be; mere beggings of the question. To kill fish outright is a  
different matter. Death is common to all; and a trout, speedily  
killed by a man, may suffer no worse fate than from the jaws of a  
pike. It is the mode, the lingering cat-like cruelty of the angler's  
sport, that renders it unworthy. If fish were made to be so treated,  
then men were also made to be racked and throttled by Inquisitors.  
Indeed among other advantages of angling. <persName key="Charles Cotton">Cotton</persName> reckons up a  
tame fish-like acquiescence to whatever the powerful chuse to inflict. </p>

<p>And this was no pastoral fiction. The anglers of those times, whose  
pastimes became famous from the celebrity of their names, chiefly  
in divinity, were great fallers in with passivcL obedience. They  
seemed to think (whatever they found it necessary to say now  
and then up on that point) that the great had as much right to prey  
upon men, as the small had upon fishes : only the men luckily had  
not hooks put into their jaws, and the sides of their cheeks torn to  
pidces. The two most famous anglers in history are <persName key="Mark Antony">Antony</persName> and  
<persName key="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</persName>. These extremes of the angling character are very edifying.  
We should like to know what these grave divines would have said  
to the heavenly maxim of <q>Do as you would be done by.</q> Let us  
imagine ourselves, for instance, a sort of human fish. Air is but a  
rarer fluid; and at present, in this November weather, a supernatural  
being who should look down upon us from a higher atmosphere,  
would, have some reason to regard us as a kind of pedestrian carp.  
Now fancy a Genius fishing for us. Fancy him baiting a' great hook  
with pickled salmon, and twitching up old <persName key="Izaak Walton">Isaac Walton</persName> from the  
banks of the <placeName type="physical" key="river Lee" corresp="Ireland">river Lee</placeName>, with the hook through his ear. How he  
would go up roaring and screaming, and thinking the devil had got  
him ! </p>

<p>We repeat, that if fish were made to be so treated, then we were  
just as much made to be racked and suffocated; and a footpad might  
have argued that old <persName key="Izaak Walton">Isaac</persName> was made to have his pocket picked, and

then tumbled into the river. There is no end of these idle and  
selfish beggings of the question, which at last argue quite as much  
against us as for us. And granting them, for the sake of argument,  
it is still obvious, on the very same ground, that men were also made  
to be taught better. We do not say, that all anglers are of a cruel  
nature. Many of them, doubtless, are amiable men in other matters.  
They have only never thought perhaps on that side of the  
question, or been accustomed from childhood to blink it. But once  
thinking, their amiableness and their practice become incompatible;  
and if they should wish, on that account, never to have thought  
upon the subject, they would only shew, that they cared for their  
own exemption from suffering, and not for its diminution in general. </p>

<head type="header">CASTS FROM SCULPTURE AND GEMS. </head>

<p>There is a set of Italians now going about the streets, who sell  
busts, vases, and other casts in plaister. Every body may not be  
aware, that some of these casts are after the antique. There is a  
head, for instance, of the Apollo Belvedere from the statue at <placeName type="city" key="Rome" corresp="Italy">Rome</placeName>;  
another of <persName key="Homer">Homer</persName>; another of <persName key="Antinous">Antinous</persName>; another, we believe, of a  
<persName key="Melpomene">Melpomene</persName>, crowned with vine-leaves in allusion to the origin of  
tragedy, and a head of <persName key="Sappho">Sappho</persName>, which, if we are not mistaken, is  
from an ancient gem. They are more frequently seen with busts from  
statues by <persName key="Canova">Canova</persName>, such as a <persName key="Paris">Paris</persName> and a <persName key="Venus">Venus</persName>; which latter, we  
confess, with its little scratches of curls in front, and its hair tied up  
behind like a lump of sausages, we cannot admire. But they will  
procure the antiques, if asked for. Some of the vases are from the  
antique; some Florentine, which are fine, but not so good; some  
French, which are the least in merit. The casts of figures, though  
copied from the antique, are inferior to the busts. The latter are  
from good old casts; sometimes worn, but still retaining the general  
spirit of the original. The figures are from slight and hasty moulds;  
feeble abridgments,— yet not without their worth either, as resembling  
the originals, however faintly. There is the Venus de Medici,  
the Gladiator, the Quoit-Player, the Antinous, the Piping Faun, the  
Apollo Belvedere, all after the antique; and there is a Couching  
Venus, after <persName key="John of Bologna">John of Bologna</persName>, the original of which must have been  
like <persName key="Venus">Venus</persName> re-appearing from the antique world. </p>

<p>Fewer people are aware how cheaply these things are sold. The  
little statues are three or four shillings apiece, perhaps less ; and a  
profit is got upon the head of <persName key="Sappho">Sappho</persName> at eighteen-pence. You may  
set a price upon <persName key="Paris">Paris</persName>'s head, and have the knave brought you at two  
shillings. </p>

<pb n="48"/>

<p>Impressions from ancient gems are now also to be had with singular  
cheapness, in consequence of an invention of <persName key="Mr. Tassie">Mr. Tassie</persName>'s, of  
<placeName type="landmark" key="Leicester-square" corresp="England">Leicester-square</placeName>. He has found out a composition, which enables him  
to procure in a few days, for three and sixpence, an impression exactly  
resembling that of any gem you may select. This you may either  
have set for your watch-chain, or keep in your desk or pocket; for  
the composition is very hard, and does not easily wear or chip off,  
even at the edges. In a seal or a desk, it might last, we should  
think, as long as the gem itself. <persName key="Mr. Tassie">Mr. Tassie</persName>'s collection of antiques  
appears to be very extensive. You may have your choice among  
all the gods and graces of the ancient world, — <persName key="Jupiter">Jupiter</persName>s, <persName key="Apollo">Apollo</persName>s,  
<persName key="Venus">Venus</persName>es, the Graces, the Muses, Lyres, Loves, Festivals, Pastorals,  
Patriots, Poets, and Philosophers. </p>

<p>It may be made an objection to the busts and other plaister casts,  
that being so white and of such a material, they will not keep clean.  
But they will keep as clean and as long too as the seals, if taken care of.  
You have only to wash them lightly but completely over with a brush  
dipped in linseed oil; and besides their taking a fine yellowish hue,  
much better than the cold white, the dust may be brushed off ever  
after as easily as from an oil painting. Paint will secure them in the  
same way; but it is apt to injure the marking and expression, by  
thickening the outline, and filling up the more delicate hollows. </p>

<p>Thus for eighteen-pence, a room may be adorned with a cast after  
the antique. And it must be a very fine picture, in our opinion,  
which can equal the effect even of a bust, much less of a large statue.  
There is a kind of presence in sculpture, which there is not in the  
flat surface and more obvious artifice of painting. It is more  
companion-like; of rather, it is more godlike, intellectual, and  
predominant. The very beauty of its shape becomes meditative. There is a  
look in its calm, sightless eyes, that seems to dispense with the  
common medium of vision; — a perceiving thought, an undisturbable  
depth of intuition. </p>
