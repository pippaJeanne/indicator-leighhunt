                    <p> We know not what will be thought of our taste in so important a matter, but
                        we must confess we are not fond of a new hat. There is a certain insolence
                        about it: it seems to value itself upon it's finished appearance, and to
                        presume upon our liking before we are acquainted with it. In the first
                        place, it comes home more like a marmot or some other living creature, than
                        a manufacture. It is boxed up, and wrapt in silver paper, and brought
                        delicately. It is as sleek as a lap-dog. Then we are to take it out as
                        nicely, and people are to wonder how we shall, look in it. <persName key="Maria">Maria</persName> twitches
                        one this way, and <persName key="Sophia">Sophia</persName> that, and <persName key="Caroline">Caroline</persName> that, and <placeName key='Catharine'>Catharine</placeName> t'other. We
                        have the difficult task, all the while, of looking easy, till the ap-
                        proving votes are pronounced: our only resource (which is also difficult)
                        is to say good things to all four; or to clap the hat upon each of their
                        heads, and see what pretty milk-women they make. At last the approving votes
                        are pronounced; and (provided it is fine) we may go forth. But how uneasy
                        the sensation about the head! How unlike the old hat, to which we, had
                        become used, and which must now make way for this fop of a stranger! We
                        might do what we liked with the former. Dust, rain, a gale of wind, a fall,
                        a squeeze,—nothing affected it. It was a true friend, a friend for all
                        weathers. It's appearance only was against it: in every thing else it was
                        the better for wear. But if the roads or the streets are too dry, the new
                        hat is afraid of getting dusty: if there is wind, and it is not tight, it
                        may be blown off into the dirt: we may have to scramble after it through
                        dust or mud; just rea<placeName key='chin'>chin</placeName>g it with our fingers, only to see it blown away
                        again. <persName key="And">And</persName> if rain comes on! Oh ye gallant apprentices, who have issued
                        forth on a Sunday morning, with <persName key="Jane">Jane</persName> or <persName key="Susan">Susan</persName>, careless either of storms at
                        night-fall, or toils and scoldings next day! Ye, who have received your new
                        hat and boots but an hour before ye set out; and then issue forth
                        triumphantly, the charmer by your side! She, with arm in yours, and <pb
                            n="170" /> handkerchief in hand, blushing, or eating gingerbread, trips
                        on: ye, admiring, trudge: we ask ye, whether love itself has prevented ye
                        from feeling a certain fearful consciousness of that crowning glory, the new
                        and glossy hat, when the first drops of rain announce the coming of a
                        shower? Ah, hasten, while yet it is of use to haste; ere yet the spotty
                        horror fixes on the nap! Out with the protecting handkerchief, which tied
                        round the hat, and flowing off in a corner behind, shall gleam through the
                        thickening night like a suburb comet! Trust not the tempting yawn of
                        stable-yard or gate-way, or the impossible notion of a coach! The rain will
                        continue; and alas! ye are not so rich as in the morning. Hasten! or think
                        of a new hat's becoming a rain-spout! Think of it's well-built crown, it's
                        graceful and well-measured fit, the curved-up elegance of it's rim, it's
                        shadowing gentility when seen in front, it's ar<placeName key='chin'>chin</placeName>g grace over the ear when
                        beheld sideways! Think of it also the next day! How altered, how dejected! <l>How
                        changed from him, </l>
                    <l>That life of measure, and
                            that soul of rim! </l> Think of the paper-like change of it's
                        consistence; of it's limp sadness,—it's confused and flattened nap, and of
                        that polished and perfect circle, which neither brush nor hot iron shall
                        restore! We have here spoken of the beauties of a new hat; but abstractedly
                        considered, they are very problematical. Fashion makes beauty for a time.
                        Our ancestors found a grace in the cocked hats now confined to beadles,
                        Chelsea Pensioners, and coachmen. They would have laughed at our
                        chimney-tops with a border; though upon the whole we do think them the more
                        graceful of the two. The best modern covering for the head was the imitation
                        of the broad Spanish hat in use about thirty years back, when Mr. Stothard
                        made his designs for the Novelist's Magazine. But in proportion as society
                        has been put into a bustle, our hats seem to have narrowed their dimensions:
                        the flaps were clipped off more and more till they became a rim; and now the
                        rim has contracted to a mere nothing; so that what with our close heads and
                        our tight succinct mode of dress, we look as if we were intended for nothing
                        but to dart backwards and forwards on matters of business, with as little
                        hindrance to each other as possible. </p>
                    <p> This may give us a greater distaste to the hat than it deserves; but
                        good-looking or not, we know of no situation in which a new one can be said
                        to be useful. We have seen how the case is during bad weather: but if the
                        weather is in the finest condition possible, with neither rain nor dust,
                        there may be a hot sunshine and then the hat is too narrow to shade us: no
                        great evil, it is true! but we must have our pique out against the knave,
                        and turn him to the only account in our power:— we must write upon him. For
                        every other purpose, we hold him as naught. The only place a new hat can be
                        carried into with safety, is a church; for there is plenty of room there.
                        There also takes place it's only union of the ornamental with the useful, if
                        so it is to be called:— we allude to the preparatory ejaculation whispered
                        into it by the genteel worshipper, before he turns <pb n="171" />round and
                        makes a bow to Mr. and Mrs. Jones and the Miss Thompsons. There is a formula
                        for this occasion; and doubtless it is often used, to say nothing of
                        extempore effusions:— but there are wicked imaginations, who suspect that
                        instead of devouter whisperings, the communer with his lining sometimes
                        ejaculates no more than Swallow, St. James's-street; or, Augarde and <placeName key='Spain'>Spain</placeName>,
                        Hatters, No. 51, Oxford-street, London:— after which he draws up his head
                        with infinite gravity and preparation, and makes the gentle recognition
                        aforesaid.</p>
                    <p> But wherever there is a crowd, the new hat is worse than
                        useless. It is a pity that the general retrenchment of people's finances did
                        away with the flat opera hat, which was a very sensible thing. The round one
                        is
                        only in the way. The matting over the floor of the Opera does not hinder it
                        from
                        getting dusty; not to mention it's chance of a kick from the inconsiderate.
                        But
                        from the pit of the other theatres, you may bring it away covered with
                        saw-dust,
                        or rubbed up all the wrong way of the nap, or monstrously squeezed into a
                        shapeless lump. The least thing to be expected in a pressure, is a great
                        poke in
                        it's side like a sunken cheek. </p>
                    <p> <persName key="Boating">Boating</persName> is a mortal enemy to new hats. A shower
                        has you fast in a common boat; or a sail-line, or an inexperienced oar, may
                        knock the hat off; and then fancy it tilting over the water with the tide,
                        soaked all the while beyond redemption, and escaping from the tips of your
                        outstretched fingers, while you ought all to be pulling the contrary way
                        home.</p>
                    <p> But of all wrong boxes for a new hat, avoid a mail-coach. If you keep it on,
                        you will begin nodding perhaps at midnight, and then it goes jamming against
                        the side of the coach, to the equal misery of it's nap and your own. If you
                        take it off, where is it's refuge? Will the clergyman take the least heed of
                        it, who is snoring comfortably in one corner in his nightcap? Or will the
                        farmer, jolting about inexorably Or the regular traveller, who in his
                        fur-cap and infinite knowledge of highway conveniences, has already beheld
                        it with contempt? Or the old market-woman, whom it is in vain to request to
                        be tender? Or the young damsel, who wonders how you can think of sleeping in
                        such a thing? In the morning, you suddenly miss your hat, and ask after it
                        with trepidation. The traveller smiles. They all move their legs, but know
                        nothing of it; till the market-woman exclaims, <q type="spoken">Deary me!
                        Well - lord, only think! A
                            hat,
                            is it, Sir? Why I do believe,—but I'm sure I never thought o'such a
                        thing
                            more than the
                            child unborn.—that it must be a hat then which I took for a pan I've
                        been a
                            buying; and so I've had my warm foot in it. <persName key="Lord">Lord</persName> bless us, ever since

                    <p> It is but fair to add that we happen to have an educated antipathy to the
                        hat. At our school no hats were worn, and the cap was too small to be a
                        substitute. It's only use is to astonish the old ladies in the street, who
                        wonder how so small a thing can be kept on; and to this end, it used to be
                        rubbed into the back or side of the head, where it hung <pb n="172" />like a
                        worsted wonder. It is after the fashion of <placeName key='Catharine'>Catharine</placeName>'s cap in the play: it

                        Ill befall us, if we ever dislike any thing about thee, old nurse of our
                        childhood! How independent of the weather, used we to feel in our old
                        friar's dress,—our thick shoes, yellow worsted stockings, and coarse long
                        coat or gown! Our cap was oftener in our hand than on our head, let the
                        weather be what it would. We felt a pride as well as pleasure, when every
                        body else was hurrying through the streets, in receiving the full summer
                        showers with uncovered poll, sleeking our glad hair like the feathers of a
                        bird. </p>
                    <p> It must be said for hats in general, that they are a very ancient part of
                        dress, perhaps the most ancient; for a negro who has nothing else upon him,
                        sometimes finds it necessary to guard off the sun with a hat of leaves or
                        straw. The Chinese, who carry their records farther back than any other
                        people, are a hatted race, both narrow-brimmed and broad. We are apt to
                        think of the Greeks as a bare-headed people; and they liked to be so; but
                        they had hats for journeying in, such as may be seen on the statues of
                        Mercury, who was the god of travellers. They were large and flapped, and
                        were sometimes fastened round under the <placeName key='chin'>chin</placeName> like a lady's straw-bonnet. The
                        Eastern nations generally wore turbans, and do still, with the exception of
                        the Persians, who have exchanged them for large conical caps of felt. The
                        Romans copied the Greeks in their dress, as in every thing else; but the
                        poorer orders wore a cap like their boasted Phrygian ancestors, resembing
                        the one which the reader may now see about the streets upon the busts of
                        <persName key="Canova">Canova</persName>'s <placeName key='Paris'>Paris</placeName>. The others would put their robes about their heads upon
                        occasion,—a custom which probably gave rise to the hoods of the middle ages,
                        and to the cloth head-dresses which we see in the portraits of <persName key="Dante">Dante</persName> and
                        <persName key="Petrarch">Petrarch</persName>. From these were taken the draperies on the heads of our old
                        <persName key="Plantagenet">Plantagenet</persName> kings and of <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>. The velvet cap which succeeded, appears
                        also to have come from <placeName key='Italy'>Italy</placeName>, as in the portraits of <persName key="Raphael">Raphael</persName> and <persName key="Titian">Titian</persName>: and
                        it would probably have continued till the French times of <persName key="Charles">Charles</persName> the
                        Second, for our ancestors up to that period were always great admirers of
                        <placeName key='Italy'>Italy</placeName>, had not <persName key="<persName key="Philip">Philip</persName> the Second"><persName key="Philip">Philip</persName> the Second</persName> of <placeName key='Spain'>Spain</placeName> come over to marry our Queen Mary.
                        The extreme heats of <placeName key='Spain'>Spain</placeName> had forced the natives upon taking to that
                        ingenious union of the hat and umbrella, still known by the name of the
                        Spanish hat. We know not whether <persName key="Philip">Philip</persName> himself wore it. His father, <persName key="Charles">Charles</persName>
                        the Fifth, who was at the top of the world, is represented as delighting in
                        a little humble-looking cap. But we conceive it was either from <persName key="Philip">Philip</persName>, or
                        some gentleman in his train, that the hat and <pb n="173" /> feather
                        succeeded among us to the cap and jewels of Henry the 8th. The ascendancy of
                        <placeName key='Spain'>Spain</placeName> in these times carried it into other parts of Europe. The French, not
                        requiring so munch shade from the sun, and always playing with and altering
                        their dress, like a child with his toy, first covered the brim with
                        feathers, then gave them a pinch in front; then came pinches up at the side;
                        and at last appeared the fierce and triple-daring cocked hat. This
                        disappeared in our childhood, or only survived among the military, the old,
                        and the reverend, who could not willingly part with their habitual dignity.
                        An old beau or so would also retain it, in memory of it's victories when
                        young. We remember it's going away from the heads of the footguards. The
                        heavy dragoons retained it till very lately. It is now almost sunk into the
                        mock-heroic, and confined, as we before observed, to beadles and coachmen,
                        &amp;c. The modern clerical beaver, agreeably to the deliberation with which
                        our establishments depart frpm old custom, is a cocked hat with the hind
                        flap let down, and only a slight pinch remaining in front. This is what is
                        worn also by the judges, the lawyers being of clerical extraction. Still
                        however the true cocked-hat lingers here and there with a solitary old
                        gentleman; and wherever it appears in such company, begets a certain
                        retrospective reverence. There was a something in it's connexion with the
                        high-bred drawing-room times of the 17th century; in the gallant though
                        quaint ardour of it's look; and in it's being lifted up in salutations with
                        that deliberate loftiness, the arm ar<placeName key='chin'>chin</placeName>g up in front and slowly raising it
                        by the front angle with finger and thumb,—that could not easily die. We
                        remember, when our steward at school, remarkable for his inflexible air of
                        precision and dignity, left off his cocked hat for a round one, there was,
                        undoubtedly, though we dared only half confess it to our minds, a sort of
                        diminished majesty about him. His infinite self-possession began to look
                        remotely finite. His Crown-Imperial was a little blighted. It was like
                        divesting a column of it's capital. But the native stateliness was there,
                        informing the new hat. He <q type="written">
                            <l>Had not yet lost</l>
                            <l><hi rend="italic">All</hi> his original beaver; nor appeared</l>
                            <l>Less than arch-steward ruined, and the excess</l>

                        </q> The late Emperor Paul had
                        conceived such a sense of the dignity of the cocked hat, aggravated by it's
                        having given way to the round one of the French republicans, that he ordered
                        all persons in his dominions never to dare be seen in public with round
                        hats, upon pain of being knouted and sent to Siberia.</p>
                    <p>Hats, being the easiest part of the European dress to be taken off, are
                        doffed among us out of reverence. The <placeName key='Orientals'>Orientals</placeName>, on the same account, put
                        off their slippers instead of turbans; which is the reason why the Jews
                        still keep their heads covered during worship. The Spanish grandees have the
                        privilege of wearing their hats in the royal presence, probably in
                        commemoration of the free spirit in which the Cortes used to crown the
                        sovereign; telling him (we sup<pb n="174" />pose in their corporate
                        capacity) that they were better men than he, but chose him of their own free
                        will for their master. The grandees only claim to be as good men, unless
                        their families are older. There is a well-known story of a picture, in which
                        the Virgin Mary is represented with a label coming out of her mouth, saying
                        to a Spanish gentleman, who has politely taken off his hat, <q type="spoken"><placeName key='Cousin'>Cousin</placeName>,
                        be covered.</q> But the most interesting anecdote connected with a hat,
                        belongs to the family of the De Courcys, <persName key="Lord">Lord</persName> Kinsale. One of their
                        ancestors, at an old period of our history, having overthrown a huge and
                        insolent champion, who had challenged the whole court, was desired by the
                        king to ask him some special favour. He requested that his descendants
                        should have the privilege of keeping their heads covered in the royal
                        presence; and they do so to this day. The new lord, we believe, always comes
                        to court on purpose to vindicate his right. We have heard, that on the last
                        occasion, probably after a long interval, some of the courtiers thought it
                        might as well have been dispensed with; which was a foolish as well as a
                        jealous thing: for these exceptions only prove the royal rule. The Spanish
                        grandees originally took their privilege instead of receiving it; but when
                        the spirit of it had gone, their covered heads were only so many intense
                        recognitions of the king's dignity, which it was thought such a mighty thing
                        to resemble. A Quaker's hat is a more formidable thing than a grandee's. </p>

                        husband, when the circumstance came to his knowledge, felt nothing 
                        but a generous pride at the deity's admiration of his beloved wife; 
                        and with all care and tenderness brought up the infant demi-god 
                        with his own twin son Iphiclus. But, <persName key="Juno">Juno</persName>'s feelings were not so 
                        godlike as the mortal's. She laid various plans for the destruction of 
                        this new child of her husband's; and among others, sent two dreadful 
                        serpents at midnight to devour it. This is the subject of the present 
                        idyll, which in the original is exceedingly fine and real, and shews 
                        that Theocritus had a perception of grandeur becoming his deep 
                        insight into nature in general. We have seen an outline after a picture 
                        of this story by one of the Caracci, which must be very noble; 
                        though his Hercules seems to retain too little of the unconscious 
                        baby. His look is too full of intention. The poet has preserved an 
                        admirable propriety in this respect.</p>

                            are accused of being too bodily and superficial in their philosophy. It was one of the 
                            advantages however of their attention to these exoterical matters, that they never lost
                            sight of the connexion between mind and body, and their mutual healthiness, beauty, and
                            power;—a part of wisdom which our modern psychosophists are so apt to forget.

                    <p>In removing a quantity of papers, we have unfortunately mislaid some letters 
                        from correspondents. We hope to recover them; but should we still be disappointed, 
                        the writers will perhaps have the goodness to oblige us with other 
                        copies. We have not forgotten the substance however of some of them; and 
                        least of all, what was so good-naturedly said upon the article on the Heathen 
                        Mythology.
