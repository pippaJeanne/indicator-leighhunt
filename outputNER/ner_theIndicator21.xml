                <p>THE following scenes are from a play which the Editor intended 
                    to write, and belonged to the more serious part of it. The rest he 
                    has retained for another purpose. The objects of the piece in gene-
                    ral were to shew the character of an English gentleman in the time 
                    of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>; the manners at the same period of the Venetians, both 
                    rich and poor; and the generous struggle of a mother to suppress a 
                    passion she conceived for our countryman, who had saved her daughter 
                    from drowning. The accident, like the scheme of Pollexfen in <persName key="Sir">Sir</persName> 
                    <persName key="Charles Grandison">Charles Grandison</persName>, had been purposely contrived by a Venetian of
                    darker character, <placeName key='Malipiero'>Malipiero</placeName>, as the only means of gaining the young
                    lady's affection; but the <persName key="Englishman">Englishman</persName> was quicker to rescue her, and 
                    so threw him doubly aback. The incidents, or rather the dialogues, 
                    which took place imediately after this circumstance, occup the 
                    scenes now laid before the reader. <persName key="<placeName key='Vit'>Vit</placeName>toria"><placeName key='Vit'>Vit</placeName>toria</persName> and <persName key="Flammetta">Flammetta</persName>, the mother 
                    and daughter, are of a similar character for goodness and frankness; 
                    but the one is the more stately minded, the other sparkling and full 
                    of spirits. <persName key="<placeName key='Cand'>Cand</placeName>ian"><placeName key='Cand'>Cand</placeName>ian</persName>, her grand-uncle, <persName key="Sebastian">Sebastian</persName>, her brother, Mo-
                    lino, <persName key="<persName key="Cont">Cont</persName>arini"><persName key="Cont">Cont</persName>arini</persName>, and <placeName key='Malipiero'>Malipiero</placeName>, are Venetian gentlement, the four first 
                    of different characters of sprightliness or warmth; the last an intel-
                    igent man like the rest, but of a violent and envious disposition. 
                    <persName key="<persName key="Van">Van</persName>ni"><persName key="Van">Van</persName>ni</persName> and <persName key="<persName key="Greg">Greg</persName>ory"><persName key="Greg">Greg</persName>ory</persName> are the servants of <persName key="<placeName key='Cand'>Cand</placeName>ian"><placeName key='Cand'>Cand</placeName>ian</persName> and the <persName key="Englishman">Englishman</persName>. 
                    With <persName key="<persName key="Walter">Walter</persName> <persName key="Herbert">Herbert</persName>"><persName key="Walter">Walter</persName> <persName key="Herbert">Herbert</persName></persName> the <persName key="Englishman">Englishman</persName>, and indeed with most of the 
                    others, it is lucky perhaps that the author had nothing farther to 
                    do; for he intended him as one of those high and graceful spirits, in 
                    the best age of this country, who were admitted to the society of its 
                    poets and other great men.

                            I sha'n't wake and find myself in the arms of the dear old chair at the Bull. My

                            the road to the seaside; then rocking up and down, up and down, till I'm sick; 
                            then scouring away again; then dragged up mountains into the clouds, till my

                            sign of the comb to scratch me; or scraped acquaintance with a brick wall; or 
                            taken to the cunning custom of flogging myself for penance; or winced, and 
                            tumbled, and beaten myself and the very air about me, like a shirt hung out to 
                            dry in a high wind:—then comes some more sea-rocking, and then says my

                        <l>From what I've read, there are some ladies who </l>

                        <l>To save one's life, only to lose one's freedom; </l>
                        <l>Begging the gentleman, that since a shark </l>

                        <l>Taken the trouble to pick you up, he'd have you. </l>
