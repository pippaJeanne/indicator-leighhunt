<p>THE following scenes are from a play which the Editor intended 
    to write, and belonged to the more serious part of it. The rest he 
    has retained for another purpose. The objects of the piece in general 
    were to <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> the character of an English gentleman in the time 
    of <persName key="queen Elizabeth I">Elizabeth</persName>; the manners at the same period of the Venetians, both 
    rich and poor; and the generous struggle of a mother to suppress a 
    passion she conceived for our countryman, who had saved her daughter 
    from drowning. The accident, like the scheme of <persName type="fictional" key="Pollexfen">Pollexfen</persName> in <title key="The History of Sir Charles Grandison" level="m">Sir 
    Charles Grandison</title>, had been purposely contrived by a Venetian of
    darker character, <persName type="fictional" key="Malipiero">Malipiero</persName>, as the only means of gaining the young
    lady's affection; but the Englishman was quicker to rescue her, and 
    so threw him doubly aback. The incidents, or rather the dialogues, 
    which took place imediately after this circumstance, occup the 
    scenes now laid before the reader. <persName type="fictional" key="Vittoria">Vittoria</persName> and <persName type="fictional" key="Flammetta">Flammetta</persName>, the mother 
    and daughter, are of a similar character for goodness and frankness; 
    but the one is the more stately minded, the other sparkling and full 
    <persName key="Contarini">Contarini</persName>, and <persName type="fictional" key="Malipiero">Malipiero</persName>, are Venetian gentlement, the four first 
    of spirits. <persName type="fictional" key="Candian">Candian</persName>, her <choice><orig>grand-uncle</orig><reg>great uncle</reg></choice>, <persName type="fictional" key="Sebastian">Sebastian</persName>, her brother, <persName type="fictional" key="Molino">Molino</persName>, 
    <persName type="fictional" key="Contarini">Contarini</persName>, and <persName type="fictional" key="Malipiero">Malipiero</persName>, are Venetian gentlement, the four first 
    of different characters of sprightliness or warmth; the last an inteligent 
    man like the rest, but of a violent and envious disposition. 
    <persName type="fictional" key="Vanni">Vanni</persName> and <persName type="fictional" key="Gregory">Gregory</persName> are the servants of <persName type="fictional" key="Candian">Candian</persName> and <persName type="fictional" key="Walter Herbert">the Englishman</persName>. 
    With <persName type="fictional" key="Walter Herbert">Walter Herbert</persName> the Englishman, and indeed with most of the 
    others, it is lucky perhaps that the author had nothing farther to 
    do; for he intended him as one of those high and graceful spirits, in 
    the best age of this country, who were admitted to the society of its 
    poets and other great men.

<l>Nay we will praise, and thank him, but not envy.</l>

<p>This comes of travelling. It seems all a dream. I'm not sure that

    so he ties me in a manner to his coat like a witch, and off I go; first scouring over 
    the road to the seaside; then rocking up and down, up and down, till I'm sick; 
    then scouring away again; then dragged up mountains into the clouds, till my 
    teeth chatter for fear and cold; then whew! down again like a flourish on paper; 
    then jolted along, all unbuttoned for heat; then bitten till I could have got the 
    sign of the comb to scratch me; or scraped acquaintance with a brick wall; or 
    taken to the cunning custom of flogging myself for penance; or winced, and 
    tumbled, and beaten myself and the very air about me, like a shirt hung out to 
    dry in a high wind:—then comes some more sea-rocking, and then says my 
    master, <q type="spoken">Now, <persName type="fictional" key="Gregory">Gregory</persName>, we land for good:</q>—thinks I, looking about me, and 
    seeing nothing but canals for streets, and houses standing out of them like so 
    many cows in a pond,——I hope we don't land for evil: and I had scarcely 
    thought the word, when we took to boating it again, and hey! presto! down
