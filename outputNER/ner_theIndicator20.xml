<l>THE stern old shepherd of the air,</l>

<l>In the <placeName type="physical" key="North Sea" corresp="North Sea" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1693">Northern evening sea</placeName>,</l>

<p><q type="spoken">Some spirit,</q> exclaimed <persName key="Duth Maruno">Duth Maruno</persName>, <q type="spoken">must pursue us, and 
perpetually urge the boat out of <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> way, or we must have arrived 
by this time at <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName>.</q>*<note type="hunt" place="foot">The old name for the Orkneys.</note> <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> took him at his word, and turning
hastily round, thought he saw an armed figure behind the stern. 
His anger rose with his despair; and with all his strength he dashed 
his arm at the moveless and airy shape. At that instant a fierce 
blast of wind half turned the boat round. The chieftains called out 
to <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> to set his whole heart at the rudder; but the wind beat 
back their voices, like young birds into the nest; and no answer 
followed it. The boat seemed less and less manageable, and at last 
to be totally left to themselves. In the intervals of the wind they 
again called out to <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>, but still received no answer. One of 
them crept forward, and felt for him through the blinding wet and 
darkness. His place was void. <q type="spoken">It was a ghost,</q> said they, <q type="spoken">which 
came to fetch him to the spirits of his fathers. <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald of the Perfect 
Hand</persName> is gone, and we shall follow him as we did in the fight. Hark! 
The wind is louder and louder: it is louder and many-voiced. Is it 
his voice which has roused up the others? Is he calling upon us, as 
he did in the battle, when his followers shouted after his call?</q></p>

<p>It was the rocks of an isle beyond <placeName type="region" key="Orkney Islands" corresp="Scotland" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q100166">Inistore</placeName>, which made that multitudinous 
roaring of the wind. The chieftains found that they were
not destined to perish in the mid ocean; but it was fortunate for
them that the wind did not set in directly upon the island, or they
would have been dashed to pieces upon the rocks. With great difficulty 
they stemmed their way obliquely; and at length were thrown
violently to shore, bruised, wounded, and half inanimate. They
remained on this desolate island two days, during the first of which
the storm subsided. On the third, they were taken away by a boat
of seal-hunters.</p>

<p>The chiefs, on their arrival at home, related how <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald of the 

<pb n="156"/>

Perfect Hand</persName> had been summoned away by a loud-voiced spirit, and 
disappeared. Great was the mourning in <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName> for the Perfect 
Hand; for the Hand that with equal skill could throw the javelin 
and traverse the harp; could build the sudden hut of the hunter; 
and bind up the glad locks of the maiden tired in the dance. Therefore 
was he called <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand" ref="#ronald">the Perfect Hand</persName>; and therefore with great
mourning was he mourned; yet with non half as great as by his 
love, his betrothed bride <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Moilena</persName>; by her of the Beautiful Voice, who 
had latterly begun to be called <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">the Perfect Voice</persName>, because she was to 
be matched with <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">him of the Perfect Hand</persName>. <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Perfect Hand</persName> and <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Perfect 
Voice</persName> were they called; but the Hand was now gone, and <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">the 
Voice</persName> sang brokenly for tears.</p>

<p>A dreary winter was it, though a victorious, to the people of <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName>. 
Their swords had conquered in Lochlin; but most of the
hands that wielded them had never come back. Their warm pressure
was felt no more. The last which they had given their friends was
now to serve them all their lives. <q type="spoken">Never, with all my yearning,</q>
said <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Moilena</persName>, <q type="spoken">shall I look upon his again, as I have looked at it a
hundred times, when nobody suspected. Never.</q> And she turned
from the sight of the destructive ocean, which seemed as interminable
as her thoughts.</p>

<p>But winter had now passed away. The tears of the sky at least
were dried up. The sun looked out kindly again; and the spring
had scarcely re-appeared, when <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName> had a proud and a gladder
day, from the arrival of the young prince of Lochlin with his bride.
It was a bitter one to <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Moilena</persName>, for the prince came to thank <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>
for sparing his life in the war, and had brought his lady to thank him
too. They thanked <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Moilena</persName> instead; and proud, in the midst of her
unhappiness, of being the representative of <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">the Perfect Hand</persName>, she
lavished hundred of smiles upon them from her pale face. But she
wept in secret. She could not bear this new addition to the store of
noble and kind memories respecting her <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>. He had spared the
bridegroom for his bride. He had hoped to come back to his own.
She looked over to the north; and thought that her home was as
much there as in <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName>.
</p>

<p>Meantime, <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> was not drowned. A Scandinavian boat, bound 
for an island called the <placeName type="region" key="Stromness" corresp="Scotland" cert="low">Island of the Circle</placeName>, had picked him up. 
The crew, which consisted chiefly of priests, were going thither to 
propitiate the deities, on account of the late defeat of their countrymen. 
They recognized the victorious chieftain, who on coming to 
his senses freely confessed who he was. Instantly they raised a
chorus, which rose sternly through the tempest. <q type="spoken">We carry,</q> said 
they, <q type="spoken">an acceptable present to the Gods. <persName type="fictional" key="Odin">Odin</persName>, stay thy hand from 
the slaughter of the obscure. <persName type="fictional" key="Thor">Thor</persName>, put down the mallet with which 
thou beatest, like red hail, on the skulls of thin enemies. Ye other 
feasters in <placeName type="fictional" key="Valhalla">Valhalla</placeName>, set down the skulls full of mead, and pledge a health 
out of a new and noble one to <persName type="fictional" key="Odin">the King of Gods</persName> and Men, that the 
twilight of heaven may come late. We bring an acceptable present: 
we bring <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald of the Perfect Hand</persName>.</q> Thus they sang in the boat, 

<pb n="157"/> 

labouring all the while with the winds and waves, but surer now
than ever of reaching the shore. And they did so, by the first light 
of the morning. When they came to <placeName type="Landmark" key="The Ring of Brodgar" corresp="Scotland" cert="low">the circle of sacred stones</placeName>, 
from which <placeName type="region" key="Stromness" corresp="Scotland" cert="low">the island</placeName> took <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> name, they placed their late conquer- 
or by the largest, and kindled a fire in the middle. The warm smoke 
rose thickly against the cold white morning. <q type="spoken">Let me be offered 
up to your gods,</q> said <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>, <q type="spoken">like a man, by the sword; and not 
like food, by the fire.</q> <q type="spoken">We know all,</q> answered the priests: <q type="spoken">be 
thou silent.</q> <q type="spoken">Treat not him,</q> said <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>, <q type="spoken">who spared your 
prince, unworthily. If he must be sacrificed, let him die as your 
prince would have died by this hand.</q> Still they answered nothing, 
but <q type="spoken">We know all: be thou silent.</q> <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> could not help witnessing 
these preparations for a new and unexpected death with an
emotion of terror; but disdain and despair were uttermost. Once, 
and but once, his cheek turned deadly pale in thinking of <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Moilena</persName>. 
He shifted his posture resolutely, and thought of the spirit of the 
dead whom he was about to join. The priests then encircled the fire 
and the stone at which he tood, with another devoting song; and 
<persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> looked earnestly at the ruddy flames, which gave to his cold 
body, as in mockery, a kindly warmth. The priests however did not 
lay hands on him. They respected the sparer of their prince so 
far as not to touch him themselves; they left him to be dispatched 
by the supernatural beings, whom they confidently expected to come 
down for that purpose as soon as they had retired.</p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>, whose faith was of another description, saw their departure
with joy; but it was damped the next minute. What was he to do in
winter-time on an island, inhabited only by the aphibious creatures
of the <placeName type="physical" key="North Sea" corresp="North Sea">northern sea</placeName>, and never touched at but for a purpose hostile
to his hopes? For he now recollected, that this was  <placeName type="region" key="Stromness" corresp="Scotland" cert="low">the island</placeName> he
ad so often heard of, as the chief seat of the Scandivnavian religion;
whose traditions had so influenced countries of a different faith, that
it was believed in <placeName type="country" key="Scotland" corresp="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> as well as the continetn, that no human
being could live there many hours. Spirits, it was thought, appeared
in terrible superhuman shapes, like the bloody idols which the priests
worshipped; and carried him off.</p>

<p><persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">The warrior of <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName></persName> had soon too much reason to know the 
extent of this belief. He was not without fear himself, but disdained 
to yield to any circumstances without a struggle. He refreshed himself 
with some snow-water; and after climbing the highest part of <placeName type="region" key="Stromness" corresp="Scotland" cert="low">the 
island</placeName> to look for a boat in vain (nothing was to be seen but the 
waves tumbling on all sides after the storm) he instantly set about 
preparing a habitation. He saw at a little distance, on a slope, the 
mouth of a rocky cave. This he destined for his shelter at night; 
and looking round for a defence for the door, as he knew not whether 
bears might not be among the inhabitants, he cast his eyes upon the 
thinnest of the stones which stood upright about the fire. The heart 
of <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">the warrior</persName>, though of a different faith, misgave him as he thought 
of appropriating this mystical stone, carved full of strange figures; 
but half in courage, and half in the very despair of fear, he suddenly 

<pb n="158"/> 

twisted it from <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> place. No one appeared. The fire altered not. 
The noise of the fowl and other creatures was no louder on the shore. 
<persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> smiled at his fears, and knew the undiminished vigour of <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">the
Perfect Hand</persName>.</p>

<p>He found the cavern already fitted for shelter; doubtless by the
Scandinavian priests. He had bitter reason to know how well it
sheltered him; for day after day he hoped in vain that some boat
from <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName> would venture upon <placeName type="region" key="Stromness" corresp="Scotland" cert="low">the island</placeName>. He beheld sails at a
distance, but they never came. He piled stone upon stone, joined
old pieces of boats together, and made flags of the sea-weed; but all
in vain. The vessels, he thought, came nearer, but none so near as
to be of use; and a new and sickly kind of impatience cut across the
stout heart of <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>, and set it beating. He knew not whether it
was with the cold or with misery, but his frame would shake for an
hour together, when he lay down on his dried weeds and feathers to
rest. He remembered the happy sleeps that used to follow upon toil;
and he looked with double activity for the eggs and sliell-fish on which
he sustained himself, and smote double the number of seals, half
in the very exercise of his anger: and then he would fall dead asleep
with fatigue.</p>

<p>In this way he bore up against the violences of the winter season,
which had now past. The sun looked out with a melancholy smile
upon the moss and the poor grass, checquered here and there with
flowers almost as poor. There was the buttercup, struggling from a
dirty white into a yellow; and a faint-coloured poppy, neither the
good nor the ill of which was then known; and here and there by the
thorny underwood a shrinking violet. The lark alone seemed chear-
ful, and startled the ear of the desolate chieftain with <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> climbing
triumph in the air. <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> looked up. His fancy had been made
wild and wilful by strange habits and sickened blood; and he thought
impatiently, that if he were up there like the lark, he might see his
friends and his love in <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName>.</p>

<p>Being naturally however of a gentle as well as courageous disposi-
tion, <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">the Perfect Hand</persName> found the advantage as well as necessity of
turning his violent impulses into noble matter for patience. He had
heard of the dreadful bodily sufferings which the Scandinavian heroes
underwent from their enemies with triumphant songs. He knew
that no such sufferings, which were fugitive, could equal the agonies
of a daily martyrdom of mind; and he cultivated a certain humane
pride of patience, in order to bear them.</p>

<p>His only hope of being delivered from the island now depended on 
the Scandinavian priests; but it was a moot point whether they 
would respect him for surviving, or kill him on that very account, 
out of a mixture of personal and superstitious resentment. He 
thought his death the more likely; but this at least was a termination 
to the dreary prospect of a solitude for life; and partly out of 
that hope, and partly from a courageous patience, he produced as 
many pleasant thoughts and objects about him as he could. He 
adorned his cavern with shells and feathers; he made himself a cap 

<pb n="159"/> 

and cloak of the latter, and boots and a vest of seal-skin, girding it 
about with the glossy sea-weed; he cleared away a circle before the 
cavern, planted it with the best grass, and heaped about it the mossiest 
stones: he strung some bones of a fish with sinews, and fitting 
a shell beneath it, the Perfect Hand drew forth the first gentle music 
that had ever been heard in that wild island. He touched it one day
in the midst of a flock of seals, who were basking in the sun; they 
turned their heads towards the sound; he thought he saw in their 
mild faces a human expression; and from that day forth no seal was 
ever slain by <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">the Perfect Hand</persName>. He spared even the huge and 
cloudy-visaged walrusses, in whose societies he beheld a dull resemblance 
to the gentler affections; and his new intimacy with these 
possessors of the place was completed by one of the former animals, 
who having been rescued by him from a contest with a larger one, 
followed him about, as well as <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> half-formed and dragging legs 
would allow, with the officious attachment of a dog.</p>

<p>But the summer was gone and no one had appeared. The new 
thoughts, and deeper insight into things, which solitude and sorrow-
ful necessity had produced, together with a diminution of his activity,
had not tended to strengthen him against the approach of winter;
and autumn came upon him like the melancholy twilight of the year.
He had now no hope of seeing even the finishers of his existence be-
fore the spring. The rising winds among the rocks, and the noise
of the whales blowing up the spouted water till the hollow caverns
thundered with their echoes, seemed to be like heralds of the stern
season which was to close him in against all approach. He had tried
one day to move the stone at the mouth of his habitation a little
further in, and found his strength fail him. He laid himself half
reclining on the chilly ground, full of such melancholy thoughts as
half bewildered him. Things by turn appeared a fierce dream and a
fiercer reality. He was leaning and looking on the ground, and
idly twisting his long hair, when his eyes fell upon the hand that
held it. It was livid and emaciated. He opened and shut it, opened
and shut it again, turned it round, and looked at <choice><orig>it's</orig><reg>its</reg></choice> ribbed thinness 
and laid-open machinery; many thoughts came upon him,
some which he understood not, and some which he recognized but
too well; and a turbid violence seemed rising at his heart, when the
seal his companion drew nigh, and began licking that weak memorial
of <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">the Perfect Hand</persName>. A shower of self-pitying tears fell upon the
seal's face and the hand together.</p>

<p>On a sudden, he heard a voice. It was a deep and loud one, and
distinctly called out, <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>! He looked up, gasping with wonder.
Three times it called out, as if with peremptory command; and three
times the rocks and caverns echoed the word with a dim sullenness.</p>

<p>Recollectinge himself, he would have risen and answered, but the 
sudden change of sensations had done what all his sufferings had not 
been able to do; and he found himself unable either to rise or to 
speak. The voice called again and again, but it was now more distant; 
and <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>'s heart sickened as he heard it retreating. His 

<pb n="160"/> 
strength seemed to fail him in proportion as it became necessary. 
Suddenly the voice came back again. It advances. Other voices are 
heard, all advancing. In a short time, figures come hastily down 
the slope by the side of his cavern, looking over into the area before 
it as they descend. They enter. They are before him and about 
him. Some of them, in a Scandinavian habit, prostrate themselves 
at his feet, and address him in an unknown language. But these 
are sent away by another, who remains with none but two youths. 
<persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> has risen a little, and leans his back against the rock. One 
of the youths puts his arm between his neck and the rock, and half 
kneels beside him, turning his face away and weeping. <q type="spoken">I am no 
god, nor a favourite of gods, as these people supposed me,</q> said <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>, 
looking up at the chief who was speaking to the other youth :– 
<q type="spoken">if thou wilt dispatch me then, do so. I only pray thee to let the 
death be fit for a warrior, such as I once was.</q> The chief appeared
agitated. <q type="spoken">Speak not ill of the gods, <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">although 
thou wert blindly brought up. A warrior like thee must be a favourite 
of heaven. I come to prove it to thee: Dost thou not know 
me? I come to give thee life for life.</q> <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> looked more steadfastly. 
It was the Scandinavian prince whom he had spared, because of his bride, in battle. He smiled, and lifted up his hand to
him, which was intercepted and kissed by the youth who held his arm round his
neck. <q type="spoken">Who are these fair youths?</q> said <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName>, 
half turning his head to look in his supporter's face. <q type="spoken">This is the 
bride I spoke of,</q> answered the prince, <q type="spoken">who insisted on sharing this 
voyage with me, and put on this dress to be the bolder in it.</q> <q type="spoken">And 
who is the other?</q> The <hi rend="italic">other</hi>, with dried eyes, looked smiling into
his, and intercepted the answer also.–<q type="spoken">Who,</q> said the sweetest 
voice in the world, <q type="spoken">can it be, but one?</q>–With a quick and almost 
fierce tone, <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> cried out aloud <q type="spoken">I know the voice;</q> and he 
would have fallen flat on the earth, if they had not all three supported 
him.</p>

<p>It was a mild return to <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName>, <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> gathering strength all the
way at the eyes and voice of <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Moilena</persName>, and the hands of all three.
Their discovery of him was easily explained. The crews of the vessels, 
who had been afraid to come nearer, had repeatedly seen a figure
on the island making signs. The Scandinavian priests related how
they had left <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">Ronald</persName> there, but insisted that no human being could
live upon it, and that some god wished to manifest himself to his
faithful worshippers. The heart of <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">Moilena</persName> was quick to guess the
truth. The prince proposed to accompany the priests. His bride
and the destined bride of his saviour went with him, and returned as
you heard; and from that day forth many were the songs in <placeName type="region" key="Orkney" corresp="Scotland">Inistore</placeName>,
upon the fortunes of <persName type="fictional" key="Ronald of the Perfect Hand">the Perfect Hand</persName> and the kindness of <persName type="fictional" key="Moilena of the Perfect Voice">the Perfect 
Voice</persName>. Nor were those forgotten, who forgot not others.</p>
