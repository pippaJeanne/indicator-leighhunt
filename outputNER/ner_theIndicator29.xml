<p>On Monday next Is May-Morning;—a word, which used to awaken 
in the minds of our ancestors all the ideas of youth, and verdure, and 
blossoming, and love, and hilarity ; in short, the union of the two best 
things in the world, the love of nature, and the love of each other. It 
was the day, on which the arrival of the year at maturity was kept, 
like that of a blooming heiress. They caught her eye as she was 
coming, and sent up hundreds of songs of joy. 

<cit><quote><lg rend="center">
<l>Now the bright Morning-Slar, Day's harbinger, </l>
<l>Comes dancing from the east, and leads with her </l>
<l>The flowery May, who from her green lap throws </l>

<l>Hail, bounteous May,, that dost inspire </l>
<l>Mirth, and youth, and warm desire: </l>
<l>Woods and groves are of thy dressing; </l>
<l>Hill, and dale, doth boast thy blessing. </l>

These songs were stopped by <persName key="John Milton" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Milton" type="real">Milton</persName>'s own friends the Puritans, whom 
in his old age he again differed with, most likely on these very points 
among others. But till then, they appear to have been as old, all over 
<placeName type="continent" key="Europe" corresp="Europe" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q46">Europe</placeName>, as the existence of society. The Druids are said to have had 
festivals in honour of May. Our Teutonic ancestors had undoubtedly; 
and in the countries which had constituted the Western Roman Empire, 
<persName type="fictional" key="Flora" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Flora_(mythology)" xml:id="Flora">Flora</persName> still saw thanks paid for her flowers, though her worship 
had gone away.
<note type="hunt">The great May holiday abserved over the West of <placeName type="continent" key="Europe" corresp="Europe">Europe</placeName> was known for centuries,
up to a late period, under the name of the Beltein or Beltane. Such a number
of etymologies, all perplexingly probable, have been found for this word, that
we have been surprised to miss among them that of Bel-temps, the Fine Time or
Season. Thus Printemps, the First Time or Prime Season, is the Spring.</note>

<p>The homage, which was paid to the Month of Love and Flowers, 
may be divided into two sorts, the general and the individual. The 
first consisted in going with others to gather May, and in joining in 
sports and games afterwards. On the first of the month, <q type="written">the juvenile
part of both sexes,</q> says <persName key="Henry Bourne" ref="https://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Bourne" type="real">Bourne</persName>, in his <title level="a" key="Antiquitates Vulgares" ref="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Antiquitates_Vulgares.html?id=Pqk_AAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">Popular Antiquities</title>, <q type="written">were
wont to rise a little after midnight and walk to some neighbouring
wood, where they broke down branches from the trees, and adorned
them with nosegays and crowns of flowers. When this was done,
they returned with their booty about the rising of the sun, and made
their doors and windows to triumph in the flowery spoil. The after
part of the day was chiefly spent in dancing round a May-pole, which
being placed in a convenient part of the village, stood there, as it
were, consecrated to the <persName type="fictional" key="Flora" ref="#Flora">Goddess of Flowers</persName> without the least violation

<p>Among the gentry and at court the spirit of the same enjoyments 
took place, modified according to the taste or rank of the entertainers. 
The most universal amusement, agreeably to the general current in the 
veins and the common participation of flesh and blood (for rank knows 
no distinction of legs and knee-pans), was dancing. Contests of chivalry 
supplied the place of more rural gymnastics. But the most 
poetical and elaborate entertainment was <title level="m" key="Arcades" cert="low">the Mask</title>. A certain flowery

But when morning pleasures are to be spoken of, the lovers of poetry 
who do not know <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>, are like those who do not know what it is 
to be up in the morning. He has left us two exquisite pictures of the 
solitary observance of May, in his <title level="a"><persName key="Palamon">Palamon</persName> and <persName key="Arcite">Arcite</persName></title><note type="editorial">"Palamon and Arcite" is the title of the translated version by John Dryden of Chaucer's "The Knight's Tale" from "The Canterbury Tales".</note>. They are the 
more curious inasmuch as the actor in one is a lady, and in the other 
a knight. How far they owe any of their beauty to his original, <title level="a">the 
Theseide</title> of <persName key="Giovanni Boccaccio">Boccaccio</persName>, we cannot say; for we never had the happiness 
of meeting with that very rare work. The Italians have so 
neglected it, that they have not only never given it a rifacimento or 
re-modelling, as in the instance of <persName key="Matteo Maria Boiardo">Boiardo</persName>'s poem, but are almost as 
much unacquainted with it, we believe, as foreign countries. <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> 
thought it worth his while to be both acquainted with it, and to make 
others so; and we may venture, to say, that we know of no Italian 
after <persName key="Giovanni Boccaccio">Boccaccio</persName>'s age who was so likely to understand him to the core, 
as his English admirer, <persName key="Ludovico Ariosto">Ariosto</persName> not excepted. Still, from what we 
have seen of <persName key="Giovanni Boccaccio">Boccaccio</persName>'s poetry, we can imagine <title level="a">the Theseide</title> to have 
been too lax and long. If <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s <title level="a"><persName key="Palamon">Palamon</persName> and <persName key="Arcite">Arcite</persName></title> be all that 
he thought proper to distil from it, it must have been greatly so; for 
it was a large epic. But at all events the essence is an exquisite one. 
The tree must have been a fine old enormity, from which such a honey 
could be drawn. </p>

<p>To begin, as in duty bound, with the lady. How she sparkles 
through the antiquity of the language, like a young beauty in an old 
hood!

We quote from memory; but this is the substance of his 
words. For our parts, we quite agree with them, as to the consignment 
of the palm, but not as to the exception about the versification. 
With some allowance as to our present mode of accentuation, it appears 
to us to be touched with a finer sense of music even than <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName>'s. 
It is more delicate, without any inferiority in strength; and still more 
various. At the same time, we do not quote <persName key="Sir Walter Scott">Sir Walter</persName> for the 
purpose of differing with him. We would only shew the more
fashionable part of our readers, what their favourite writer thinks 
of <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>; and we would also take another opportunity of contrasting 
some opinions of ours, exaggerated by party feeling and a young 
thoughtlessness, when <persName key="Sir Walter Scott">Sir Walter</persName> wrote nothing but criticism and 
poetry, with our sense of his extraordinary merits as a novelist. But

<l>"O May, with all thy flowers and thy green, </l>
<l>Right welcome be thou, fairè freshè May: </l>
<l>I hope that I some green here getten may." </l>
<l>And from his courser, with a lusty heart, </l>
<l>Into the grove full hastily he start, </l>
<l>And in a path he roamed up and down. </l>

The versification of this is not so striking as the other, but <persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName> 
again falls short in the freshness and feeling of the sentiment. His 
lines are beautiful; but they do not come home to us with so happy and 
cordial a face. Here they are. The word morning in the first line, as 
it is repeated in the second, we are bound to consider as a slip of the 
pen; perhaps for mounting.

<l>The grove I named before; and, lighted there, </l>

<l>The sultry tropic fears, and moves more slowly on. </l>

<persName key="John Dryden">Dryden</persName>'s genius, for the most part, wanted faith in nature. It was 
too gross and sophisticate. There was as much difference between 
him and his original, as between a hot noon in perukes<note type="editorial">A judge or barrister's wig. </note> at <placeName type="region" key="St. James's" corresp="England">St. James's</placeName>, 
and one of <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s lounges on the grass, of a May-morning. </p>

<p>All this worship of May is over now. There is no issuing forth, in 
glad companies to gather boughs; no adorning of houses with <q>the
flowery spoil;</q> no songs, no dances, no village sports and coronations, 
no courtly poetries, no sense and acknowledgment of the quiet presence 
of nature, in grove or glade.

<p>This time two hundred years ago, our ancestors were all anticipating
their May holidays. Bigotry came in, and frowned them away; then
Debauchery, and identified all pleasure with the town; then Avarice,
and we have ever since been mistaking the means for the end. </p>

<p>Fortunately it does not follow, that we shall continue to do so. 
Commerce, while it thinks it is only exchanging commodities, is helping

to diffuse knowledge. All other gains,—all selfish and extravagant 
systems of acquisition,—tend to over-do themselves, and to topple 
down by their own undiffused magnitude. The world, as it learns 
other things, may learn not to confound the means with the end, or at 
least, (to speak more philosophically,) a really poor means with a really 
richer. The veriest cricket-player on a green has as sufficient a quantity 
of excitement as a fundholder or a partizan; and healthy and 
spirits, and manliness to boot. Knowledge may go on; must do so, 
from necessity; and should do so, for the ends we speak of: but 
knowledge, so far from being incompatible with simplicity of pleasures, 
is the quickest to perceive its wealth. <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> would lie for hours,
