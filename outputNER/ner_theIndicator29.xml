                        our ancestors all the ideas of youth, and verdure, and blossoming, and love,
                        aiid hilarity ; in short, the union of the two besfc things in the world,
                        the love of nature, and the love of each other. It was the day, on which the
                        arrival of the year at maturity was kept, like that of a blooming heiress.
                        They caught her eye as she was coming, and sent up hundreds of songs of joy. <cit>

                        likely on these very points among others. But till then, they appear to have
                        been as old, all over Europe, as the existence of society. The Druids are
                        said to have had festivals in honour of <persName key="May">May</persName>. Our Teutonic ancestors had
                        undoubtedly; and in the countries which had constituted the Western Roman
                        Empire, Flora still saw thanks paid for her flowers, though her worship had
                        gone away.<note type="hunt">The great <persName key="May">May</persName>

                            of etymologies, all perplexingly probable, have been found for this

                    <p>The homage, which was paid to the Month of Love and Flowers, may be divided
                        into two sorts, the general and the individual. The first consisted in going
                        with others to gather <persName key="May">May</persName>, and in joining in sports and games afterwards. On
                        the first of the month, <q>the juvenile
                            part of both sexes,</q> says Bourne, in his Popular Antiquities, <q>were
                        wont to rise a little after midnight and walk to some neighbouring
                            wood, where they broke down branches from the trees, and adorned
                            them with nosegays and crowns of flowers. When this was done,
                            they returned with their booty about the rising of the sun, and made
                        their doors and windows to triumph in the flowery spoil. The after
                            part of the day was chiefly spent in dancing round a <persName key="May">May</persName>-pole, which
                        being placed in a convenient part of the village, stood there, as it
                            were, consecrated to the Goddess of Flowers without the least violation
                        offered to it, in the whole circle of the year.</q> <persName key="Spenser">Spenser</persName>, in his

                                            <hi rend="italic">Britannia's Pastorals</hi>, by William
                        Browne. Song the 4th. Browne, like his friend Wither, from whom we quoted a
                        passage last week, wanted strength and the power of selection; though not to
                        such an extent. He is however well worth reading by those who can expatiate
                        over a pastoral subject, like a meadowy tract of country; finding out the
                        beautiful spots; and gratified, if not much delighted, with the rest. His
                        genius, which was by no means destitute of the social part of passion, seems
                        to have been turned almost wholly to description by the beauties of his
                        native county Devoushire. </note>

                    <p>Among the gentry and at court the spirit of the same enjoyments took place,
                        modified according to the taste or rank of the entertainers. The most
                        universal amusement, agreeably to the general current in the veins and the
                        common participation of flesh and blood (for rank knows no distinction of
                        legs and knee-pans), was dancing. Contests of chivalry supplied the place of
                        more rural gymnastics. But the most poetical and elaborate entertainment was
                        the Mask. A certain flowerygrace was sprinkled over all; and the finest
                        spirits of the time thought they shewed both their manliness and wisdom, in
                        knowing how to raise the pleasures of the season to their height. Sir Philip
                        Sydney, the idea of whom has come down to us as a personification of all the

                            n="228" /> But when morning pleasures are to be spoken of, the lovers of
                        poetry who do not know <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>, are like those who do not know what it is to
                        be up in the morning. He has left us two exquisite pictures of the solitary
                        observance of <persName key="May">May</persName>, in his <persName key="Palamon">Palamon</persName> and <persName key="Arcite">Arcite</persName>. They are the more curious
                        inasmuch as the actor in one is a lady, and in the other a knight. How far
                        they owe any of their beauty to his original, the <persName key="These">These</persName>ide of Boccaccio, we
                        cannot say; for we never had the happiness of meeting with that very rare
                        work. The <placeName key='Ital'>Ital</placeName>ians have so neglected it, that they have not only never given
                        it a rifacimento or re-modelling, as in the instance of Boiardo's poem, but
                        are almost as much unacquainted with it, we believe, as foreign countries.
                        <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName> thought it worth his while to be both acquainted with it, and to
                        make others so; and we may venture, to say, that we know of no <placeName key='Ital'>Ital</placeName>ian after
                        Boccaccio's age who was so likely to understand him to the core, as his
                        English admirer, Ariosto not excepted. Still, from what we have seen of
                        Boccaccio's poetry, we can imagine the <persName key="These">These</persName>ide to have been too lax and
                        long. If <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>'s <persName key="Palamon">Palamon</persName> and <persName key="Arcite">Arcite</persName> be all that he thought proper to
                        distil from it, it must have been greatly so; for it was a large epic. But
                        at all events the essence is an exquisite one. The tree must have been a
                        fine old enormity, from which such a honey could be drawn. </p>

                        We quote from memory; but this is the substance of his words. For our parts,
                        we quite agree with them, as to the consignment of the palm, but not as to
                        the exception about the versification. With some allowance as to our present
                        mode of accentuation, it appears to us to be touched with a finer sense of
                        music even than Dryden's. It is more delicate, without any inferiority in
                        strength; and still more various. At the same time, we do not quote Sir
                        Walter for the purpose of differing with him. We would only shew the more
                        fashionable part of our readers, what their favourite writer thinks of
                        <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>; and we would also take another opportunity of contrasting some
                        opinions of ours, exaggerated by party feeling and a young thoughtles'sness,
                        when Sir Walter wrote nothing but criticism and poetry, with our sense of
                        his extraordinary merits as a novelist. But more of these in another place.
                        Of politics also we say nothing here. There ought to be some places in the
                        world of letters, where men*s thoughts of each other, like the knights of

                        The versification of this is not so striking as the other, but Dryden again
                        falls short in the freshness and feeling of the sentiment. His lines are
                        beautiful; but they do not come home to us with so happy and cordial a face.
                        Here they are. The word morning in the first line, as it is repeated in the
                        second, we are bound to consider as a slip of the pen; perhaps for mounting. <cit>

                    <p>This time two hundred years ago, our ancestors were all anticipating
                        their <persName key="May">May</persName> holidays. <persName key="Bigotry">Bigotry</persName> came in, and frowned them away; then
                        <persName key="Debauchery">Debauchery</persName>, and identified all pleasure with the town; then <placeName key='Avarice'>Avarice</placeName>,
                        and we have ever since been mistaking the means for the end. </p>
                    <p>Fortunately it does not follow, that we shall continue to do so. Commerce,
                        while it thinks it is only exchanging commodities, is helping to diffuse
                        knowledge. All other gains,—all selfish and extravagant systems of
                        acquisition,—tend to over-do themselves, and to topple down by their own
                        undiffused magnitude. The world, as it learns other things, may learn not to
                        confound the means with the end, or at least, (to speak more
                        philosophically,) a really poor means with a really richer. The veriest
                        cricket-player on a green has as sufficient a quantity of excitement as a
                        fundholder or a partizan; and healthy and spirits, and manliness to boot.
                        Knowledge may go on; must do so, from necessity; and should do so, for the
                        ends we speak of: but knowledge, so far from being incompatible with
                        simplicity of pleasures, is the quickest to perceive its wealth. <persName key="Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>
                        would lie for hours, looking at the daisies. <persName key="Scipio">Scipio</persName> and <persName key="Laelius">Laelius</persName> could amuse
                        themselves with making ducks and drakes on the water. <persName key="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</persName>, the
                        greatest of all the active spirits of <placeName key='Greece'>Greece</placeName>, was a flute-player and dancer.
                        <persName key="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</persName> could act the whole part of a ministrel. <persName key="Epicurus">Epicurus</persName> taught
                        the riches of temperance and intellectual pleasure in a gardern. The other
                        philosophers of his country walked between heaven, and earth in the
                        colloquial bowers of <placeName key='Academus'>Academus</placeName>; and, <q>the

                            turtle,</q> because he was a poet, a lover, and a wise man.</p>
