                    <p>There  is  a  bird  in  the  interior  of  Africa,  whose  habits  would  rather  seem  to  belong  to  the  interior  of Fairy-land:  but  they  have  been,  well  authenticated.  It  indicates  to  honey-hunters  where  the  nests  of  wild bees  are  to  be  found.  It  calls  them  with  a  cheerful  cry,  which  they  answer;  and  on  finding  itself  recognized, flies  and  hovers  over  a  hollow  tree  containing  the  honey.  While  they  are  occupied  in  collecting  it,  the  bird goes  to  a  little  distance,  where  he  observes  all  that  passes;  and  the  hunters,  wnen  they  have  helped  themselves, take  care  to  leave  him  his  portion  of  the  food. — This  is  the  <hi rend="smallcaps">Cuculus Indicator  of  Linnæus</hi>,  otherwise called  the  Moroc,  Bee  Cuckoo,  or  Honey  Bird.</p>

                    <p>IT is the object of this periodical work to notice any subjects whatsoever  
within the range of the Editor's knowledge or reading. He will take them  
up, as they happen to suggest themselves; and endeavour to point out their  
essence to the reader, so as at once to be brief and satisfactory. The subjects  
will chiefly consist of curious recollections of biography; short disquisitions  
on men and things; the most interesting stories in history or fiction told  
over again, with an eye to their proper appreciation by unvulgar minds;  
and now and then a few original verses. Indeed the whole matter, whatever  
the subject may be, will be strictly original, in one sense of the word;  
arid it will be the Editor's aim, as well as a part of his own pleasure, to  
render it all as entertaining as he can. To the unvulgar he exclusively  
addresses himself; but he begs it to be particularly understood, that in this  
description of persons are to be included all those, who without having had a  
classical education, would have turned it to right account; just as all those;  
are to be excluded, who in spite of that "discipline of humanity" think  
ill of the nature which they degrade, and vulgarly confound the vulgar with  
the uneducated.</p>

<p>The Indicator will attend to no subject whatsoever of immediate or  
temporary interest. His business is with the honey in the old woods. The  
Editor has enough to agitate his spirits during the present eventful times,  
in another periodical work, and he is willing to be so agitated : but as he  
is accustomed to use his pen, as habitually as a bird his pinion, and to  
betake himself with it into the nests and bowers of more lasting speculations,  
when he has done with public ones, he is determined to keep those haunts  
of his recreation free from all noise and wrangling, both for his own pleasure  
and for those who may chuse to accompany him.</p>

<p>The Indicator will appear every Wednesday morning, at an hour early  
enough for the breakfast-table; although the subjects will not be  
temporary or those of the moment, they will be written as much at the  
moment as if they were; so that there will still be a certain freshness of  
intercourse between the Editor and his readers.</p>

<p>THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING A NAME FOR A WORK OF THIS KIND.— Never  
did gossips, when assembled to determine the name of a new-born child,  
whose family was full of conflicting interests, experience half the difficulty  
which an author finds in settling the title for a periodical work. There is  
generally some paramount uncle, or prodigious third cousin, who is silently  
understood to have the chief claims, and to the golden lustre of whose face  
the clouds of hesitation and jealousy gradually give way. But these  
children of the brain have no godfather ready at hand : and then their single  
appellation is bound to comprise as many public interests as all the  
Christian names of a French or a German prince. It is to be modest : it is to  
be expressive : it is to be new : it is to be striking : it is to have something in  
it equally intelligible to a man of plain understanding, and surprising for  
the man of imagination : — in one word, it is to be impossible. How far  
we have succeeded in the attainment of this happy nonentity, we leave  
others to judge. There is one good thing however which the hunt after a  
title is sure to realize; — a good deal of despairing mirth. We were visiting  
a friend the other night, who can do any thing for a book but give it a  
title; and after many grave and ineffectual attempts to furnish one for the  
present, the company, after the fashion of Rabelais, and with a chair-  
shaking merriment which he might have joined in himself, fell to turning  
a hopeless thing into a jest. It was like that exquisite picture of a set of  
laughers in Shakspeare : — </p>

<cit><quote><lg><l>One rubbed his elbow, thus; and fleered, and swore </l> 
<l>A better speech was never spoke before :  </l>
<l>Another, with his finger and his thumb.  </l>
<l>Cried " Vial We will do't, come what will come!"  </l>
<l>The third he capered, and cried " All goes well!"  </l>
<l>The fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell.  </l>
<l>"With that they all did tumble on the ground.  </l>
<l>With such a zealous laughter, so profound.  </l>
<l>That in this spleen ridiculous, appears,  </l>
<l>To check their laughter, passion's solemn tears.  </l></lg></quote>
<note type="source"> <bibl><author>William Shakespeare</author>: <title>Love's Labour Lost</title>. </bibl></note></cit>

<p>Some of the names had a meaning in their absurdity, such as the Adviser,  
or Helps for Composing; — the Cheap Reflector, or Every Man His Own  
Looking- Glass; — the Retailer, or Every Man His Own Other Man's Wit;  
— Nonsense, To be Continued. Others were laughable by the mere force  
of contrast, as the Crocodile, or Pleasing Companion; — Chaos, or the  
Agreeable Miscellany; — the Fugitive Guide; — the Foot-Soldier, or Flowers  
of Wit; — Bigotry, or the Cheerful Instructor; — the Polite Repository of  
Abuse; — Blood, being a Collection of Light Essays. Others were sheer  
ludicrousness and extravagance, as the Pleasing Ancestor; the Silent  
Remarker; the Tart; the Leg of Beef by a Layman; the Ingenious  
Hatband; the Booths of Bliss; the Occasional Diner; the Tooth-ache;  
Recollections of a Very Unpleasant Nature; Thoughts on Taking up a Pair of  
Snuffers; Thoughts on a Barouche-Box; Thoughts on a Hill of Considerable  
Eminence; Meditations on a Pleasing Idea; Materials for Drinking; the  
Knocker, No. I; — the Hippopotamus Entered at Stationers' Hall; the  
Piano-forte of Paulus AEmilius; the Seven Sleepers at Cards; the Arabian  
Nights on Horseback : — with an infinite number of other mortal murders  
of common sense, which rose to "push us from our stools," and which  
none but the wise or good-natured would ever think of laughing at.</p>

<p>A MISTAKE OF MR. THOMAS PAINE'S UPON LEARNING; AND A WORD  
OR TWO ON TRANSLATION. — We speak of Mr. Paine as a deceased author  
whom it is a vulgar error to under-rate. His great natural powers have  
forced themselves into eminence through every species of obstacle. Well  
aware of them himself, seeing in what manner they were often denied, and  
what a convention there was among worldly and common-place men,  
possessed of a little scholarship, to cry down every thing but themselves, he  
ran to an extreme natural enough to such a mind, and proclaimed at once  
that all which is commonly understood by the word Learning was useless.  
He saw that others mistook the letter for the spirit; and yet in objecting  
to this mistake, he fell into one of the very same nature, and asserted that  
learning was no longer wanted, because all the "useful books" in the  
ancient languages had been translated.  By useful books, he means such  
works as Euclid's Elements : and here again he fell into an error, from  
which the true spirit of learning might have saved him : he confounded  
utility with mere science.  He forgot that for one instance in which mere  
science is necessary to our happiness, there are a hundred in which we  
have more to do with our passions and tempers, with our affections, our  
perceptions, with our ability or inability to extract pleasure from the  
innumerable things in the intellectual and external world. Utility is only  
utility in as much as it conduces somehow or other to advantage and  
pleasure. Every thing that is truly pleasurable or beautiful is as useful  
as the most scientific thing upon earth. Jane, when she smiles at us, or  
takes a country walk with us, or reads an author with us, is at least as  
good as a !Spinning Jenny!. If we have twenty pleasures from the sight of  
a cherry, such as the admiration of it's bloom, it's figure, it's scent, it's  
suitableness to the leaves, it's connexion with orchards and the country,  
and it's association with all that we have read of it in the poets, it is surely  
better than if we only knew the taste of it, and could reckon how much a  
dozen of them would come to at a farthing apiece. If we see nothing in  
the moon but a light for old gentlewomen to go home by, or a satellite to the  
earth, or even a vague beauty and serenity, we do not receive so much  
utility from it as when we recollect that it is the very same moon which  
Homer has so often looked at and so beautifully described,— which said  
beauty of description is not to be found in the translation of Pope. Now  
there is scarcely any of all the great poets in other languages, of whom the  
English reader has had a proper account from translators.  An individual  
may have so much in him, from nature, of what the writers on the side of  
beauty and imagination have done for humanity, that he may want little  
improvement from books. And we all <hi rend="italic">could</hi> go on without learning. We  
all could go on with half, or a quarter, or half a quarter of the science  
that is now in the world. But if we are to see our way to happiness through  
knowledge (and we cannot well return to it now-a-davs through the  
paths of ignorance, beset as they have been with every species of tyranny)  
then the more we know of what great minds have felt and said, the more  
we increase the general stock of humanity in its largest sense. That all  
the "useful books" therefore have been translated, must be denied.  
Intelligent men of no scholarship, on reading Horace, for instance, and Ariosto,  
through the medium of translation, have often wondered how those writers  
obtained their glory. And they well might. The translations are no more  
like the original than a walking-stick is like a flowering bough. It is the  

<pb n="4"/>

same with the versions of Euripides, of AEschylus, of Sophocles, of Theocritus  
of Petrarch, etc. etc, and in many respects of Homer. Perhaps we  
could not give the reader a more brief yet complete specimen of the way  
in which bad translations are made, than by selecting a well-known passage  
from Shakspeare, and turning it into the common-place kind of poetry  
that flourished so widely among us till of late years. Take the passage  
for instance, where the lovers in the Merchant of Venice seat themselves  
on a bank by moonlight : — </p>

<cit><quote><lg><l>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! </l> 
<l>Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music  </l>
<l>Creep in our ears; soft stillness, and the night,  </l>
<l>Become the touches of sweet harmony. </l></lg></quote>
<note type="source"><bibl>Shakespeare, William: The Merchant of Venice</bibl></note></cit>

<p>Now a foreign translator, of the ordinary kind, would dilute and take  
all taste and freshness out of this draught of poetry, in a style amounting  
to the following : — </p>

<lg><l>With what a charm, the moon, serene and bright. </l> 
<l>Lends on this bank its soft reflected light! </l>
<l>Sit we, I pray; and let us sweetly hear  </l>
<l>The strains melodious with a raptured ear;  </l>
<l>For soft retreats, and night's impressive hour, </l> 
<l>To harmony impart divinest power.</l></lg>

<p>It will be our business, where a quotation from the foreign poets occurs to  
us, to do at any rate a little better than this : and the English reader will  
have a better idea of the love-stories and other pieces of fiction which they  
have rendered so celebrated, in abridgments like ours of the utmost brevity  
and simplicity, than in whole volumes of this kind of misrepresentation.  
The simple elements of them will be laid before him; and the eye of his  
own unobstructed heart will see more of what the poets saw in them, at  
once.</p>

<p>Abaris, a mysterious personage in the time of Pythagoras. He is said  
to have received an arrow from Apollo, with which he rode through the  
air, and which he afterwards gave to Pythagoras in return for the instruction  
of that philosopher. His first appearance at Athens was in consequence  
of a pestilence which then afflicted the world, and for the cessation  
of which an oracle had enjoined the Athenians to pray in behalf of all the  
other nations. Abaris came as the representative of the Hyperboreans.  
The probability is, that he was a Pythagorean from some northern country;  
who astonished the Athenians by the rapidity of his journies, and was  
not sorry perhaps to have it thought supernatural. A metaphor has often  
been enough to make a miracle. He rode like an arrow. Drop the word  
like, and the miracle is ready. Swift says of the famous Lord Peterborough.</p>

<p>If this had been said of a man in some ages of the world, the next step  
would have been to use his apparition at once, and allow him a travelling  
ghost.</p>

<p>Abradates and Panthea, a singular example of conjugal affection on a  
throne. Abradates was king of Susa in Persia during the wars between  
Cyrus and Artaxerxes; and hearing that his wife Panthea, who had gotten  
into the hands of the former, had been treated by him with singular  
continence and respect, Cyrus having denied himself even the temptation of  
seeing her, he went over to that prince with all his troops. Unfortunately,  
he was slain in the first battle that he fought for his new friend; and  
Panthea, unable to bear the loss of so noble and affectionate a spirit, killed  
herself on his dead body. The story was first told by Xenophon, Besides  
it's own interest, it is curious as one of the few specimens afforded by the  
ancient world, of chivalrous gallantry towards a woman.</p>

<p>Uriel Acosta, a Portuguese at the beginning of the 17th century,  
presented the world with a strange instance of vacillation in religious faith.  
He first turned Jew, converting at the same time his mother and brothers,  
and fled with them to Amsterdam, where they were received into a synagogue.  
Becoming dissatisfied with some of the Jewish rites, and giving vent  
to his objections, he was excommunicated by the Jews. He then wrote a  
treatise against the immortality of the soul, for which he was seized and  
fined. After a lapse of fifteen years, he made his submission, and was  
again received; but not entirely conforming to the Mosaic law, and  
having dissuaded two Christians from adopting Judaism, he was again  
expelled. Under this second sentence he remained seven years, abandoned  
by his friends, and reduced to an extremity of wretchedness. At last, he  
again prostrated himself before the Jewish priests, and was again received  
after an extraordinary penance, during which the most melancholy and  
appalling ceremonies were gone through, candles lighted up and put out, and  
blood dropped into basons. We speak from the recollection of what  
we have read 3 but the proceeding was of this description. At the conclusion  
of these infernal ceremonies, he lay down upon the ground at the  
threshold of the synagogue, and every member of it walked over his body.  
He shot himself. — Acosta has been idly accused of impiety, and even  
of worldly selfishness. A man is not full of religious scruples out of impiety;  
much less keeps out of the pale of his worldly interest over and over again,  
and for so many years together. Perhaps his history is only an extraordinary  
instance of the perplexity arising from having had progenitors of  
different faiths. Acosta's father was a Roman- Catholic, but descended  
from a Jewish stock. The Catholics would naturally wish to keep him  
Catholic, and the Jews would naturally help his yearnings after Judaism.  
Perplexed between references to both, his mind wavered; and being an  
inquiring one, took to thinking for itself; but this was what neither  
Catholic nor Jew would tolerate. Perplexed by early prejudices; called  
upon, as it were, by the voices of his ancestors to become a Jew; making  
bold efforts to disengage himself from this cruel alternative; then plunged  
in misery; and above all, abandoned by men calling themselves his friends,  
and whom he had taken for such, a distracted state of mind, weakened  
perhaps into hopelessness by an atrabilarious temperament, drove him back,  
like a frightened animal, into the toils of his <hi rend="italic">first fear</hi>, the oldest superstition  

<pb n="6"/>

in the family. He stared about him a while, amidst the candles, the  
curses, and the dropping blood; and then went melancholy, and killed  
himself. — Thus an honest man is driven into suicide, because his ancestors  
differed in point of faith! The religionist will say that this shews the value  
of having one regular hereditary faith; but would he cease then to convert  
the heretic to his own? And what good did this do to the poor unwilling  
martyr Acosta? The philosopher will say that it shews the wretched  
tyranny of custom.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="4">
<p>Polyphemus, Acis, and Galatea, one of the most celebrated love-stories  
in ancient fable. Acis was a mortal, because his mother was so, though  
his father was the wood-god Faunus. Galatea, who loved him deeply, and  
whose passion was returned, was an immortal sea-nymph, the daughter of  
two deities of the ocean. They enjoyed the happiness of their affection in  
the delightful vales of Sicily; but unfortunately it had one drawback, 
which was the jealous importunity of Neptune's gigantic and one-eyed son,  
the terrible Polyphemus. In vain the enamoured monster implored Galatea  
to listen to him. In vain had love softened the natural ferocity of his  
manners, so that he would sit whole days on the sea-coast, watching to  
catch a glimpse of her out of the water, while the tears ran down his  
dreadful face, and he was as gentle and humble as a child. The fair nymph  
fled but the more for refuge into the arms of the handsome shepherd. The  
wretched Polyphemus, looking down one day into a valley, saw the happy  
lovers giving way to their transport; and this sight made the load of his  
despair intolerable. He rent off a fragment of the rock on which he was  
sitting; and hurling it down as Jupiter might do his thunder, smote his  
rival so as to crush him to death. Galatea, inconsolable, and unable to  
restore her lover to life, or render him a deity like herself, turned him into  
a fountain. It was after this event that we may suppose Polyphemus to  
have become the inhospitable and cruel wretch which he is described  
to be in Homer's Odyssey : and this point of view helps to throw an  
additional interest over his story, which always appeared to us one of the  
most pathetic and deeply-meaning in poetry. He was separated by his  
monstrous appearance from human kind, and yet in his heart and inclinations  
he sympathized with them. The want of this sympathy from others  
made him ireful, revengeful, impious. What moral can go to the heart of  
things more deeply than this? </p>

<p>This story has been a great favourite with all men of genius. It has  
been touched upon with great pathos and simplicity by Theocritus, who  
was followed not so well by Virgil, and with much less nature by Ovid.  
The Italian writers are so fond of it, that they have sonnets, called  
Polyphemic sonnets. Raphael painted a beautiful picture of Galatea  
triumphing on the waters, of which there are many engravings. And  
Handel finished the homage of the arts to it by that divine oratorio of Acis  
and Galatea, for which Gay contributed words not unworthy. If the reader  
wishes to know how the great poets have written on the subject, he should  
hear how Handel composed.</p>

<p>Country Houses near Town. — We have often wondered, in the midst  
of the trees and fields, how people can be aware of the existence of such  
beautiful things, and not long to enjoy them : — we mean, of course, in the  
manner as well as the degree, in which some others enjoy them : for  
though Nature will be felt and acknowledged some how or other under all  
her aspects, and though the inhabitants of the metropolis have plenty of  
little country houses scattered about the skirts of it, yet their pleasure in  
them is rather of a negative than positive kind; rather a fidgeting respite  
from smoke and noise, than a sense of the beauties of scenery or of the  
solitude. When the citizen gets out of the town, he contrives to be almost  
as much confined as when he is in it. At the best, he generally pokes  
about his garden a little, and sees that the apple trees are productive, and  
the brick walls secure. If he goes out, it is chiefly when his neighbours  
are abroad to meet him, and along the high-road. He may cross the fields  
in the morning to church, in order to take care of his eternal interests upon  
the same principle on which he takes care of his temporal every other day  
in the week; but he confines himself to the path as he, goes; he returns by  
it as ploddingly; and though not so bad as the sourer' bigot, who after  
insisting all the morning at the meeting house that the world is a vile world,  
takes all the selfish or unsocial means he can to prove his words, he spends  
the rest of the day with almost as little sense of the beauties and kindliness  
of creation, either eating and drinking himself to sleep in his easy chair, or  
treating some friends with the provisions he stuffed his carriage with the  
day before, and cultivating a hot-faced, noisy, and boozing indigestion till  
bed-time. This, and a confinement all the rest of the week to close and  
noisy streets, — the transition from dark rooms with windows half dust and  
half board, to the bargaining uproar of an Exchange, — the total ignorance  
of all intellectual pleasures, an utter deadness to what is called sentiment,  
— a person which has no graces in consequence, — a face, sometimes jovial  
but not happy, generally care-worn, and always vulgar, — an enjoyment,  
such as it is, allied to gambling, and cut with a thousand anxieties, — an  
unhealthy temperament, always contradicting his comfort also, though he  
may not know as much, — toil, toil, toil, every morning, — indigestion,  
indigestion, every evening, — a gout in his old age, and a bad conscience all  
his life, — such is the picture of a complete, successful, flourishing,  
sophisticated, money-getting animal; who is called "a good man," because his  
knaveries enable him to pay; and a knowing one, because he has found  
out with infinite labour and pains how to make himself forty times as  
uncomfortable as other people.</p>

<p>All this comes from imaginary wants, and from abandoning nature in  
order to get as much as possible out of art; whereas art with twenty times  
the toil will never yield a twentieth part of the real harvest. A third of  
the industry that is now thought necessary, and an improved knowledge  
which does not confound good taste with expensiveness, would leave mankind  
to the enjoyment of a leisure and a happiness, which they have only  
tasted at intervals. But in the mean time, instead of happiness being  
attended- to, the phrase is, that "business must be attended to." The  
same pains, or mere profligacies, are bequeathed to children; and with the  
exception of a few understandings who have survived the convulsions of  
the times, and have got hold of a weapon against error", which wisdom never  
had before, and which we trust it will never let go — the middle classes in  
this green and beautiful country, make a religion of their money-getting  

<pb n="8"/>

and town habits, sitting in their well-clothed stupidity, and sneering with  
as much ignorant scepticism at all improvement, as ever their <choice><sic>ancestros</sic> <corr>ancestors</corr> </choice> 
might have done in their painted skins.</p>

<p>The present generation, in this respect, is too old and too foolish to  
mend; but the rising one has new light; and how easily might it see, not  
only from the sophistications of it's parents, but from their sufferings and  
even their little unconscious hankerings after something better, the policy  
of improving it's habits of thinking! How much better would it be to  
have a third of the toil, and a twentieth part of the anxiety! How much  
better to have air and exercise every day, instead of once a week! How  
much better to have cheap luxuries, easy digestions, cool slumbers, and  
quiet minds!</p>

<p>Nor is this mere talking, or a thing only to be found in books; as if  
there were no medium between the extreme of folly and that of injustice.  
Let them come out in the fields, and see. Let them read of the smaller  
country gentlemen, a class which has since vanished, — of archeries and  
other rural sports, of the old mixture of business and pleasure, which were  
in a more reassonable proportion than now; and let them add to these, the  
improvements which philosophy would now enable them to make in a  
thousand matters involving the common good; and they would soon see  
the folly of wasting their time by a mistaken sense of it.</p>

<p>Upon this subject we shall present our readers by and by with a story  
of a man who never went out of the metropolis for ten years, and what  
took him out of it at last.</p>

<l>Come, master of the rosy art.</l>  
<l>Thou painter after my own heart.</l>
<l>Come, paint my absent love for me.</l>
<l>As I shall describe her thee.</l>
<l>Paint me first her fine dark hair.</l>
<l>Fawning into ringlets there;</l>
<l>And if brush has power to do it,</l>
<l>Paint the odour breathing through it.</l>
<l>Then from out her ripe young cheek.</l>
<l>Underneath those tresses sleek.</l>
<l>Paint her brow of ivory;</l>
<l>Taking care the eyebrows be</l>
<l>Not apart, nor mingled neither.</l>
<l>But as her's are, stol'n together;</l>
<l>Met by stealth, yet leaving too</l>
<l>O'er the eyes their darkest hue.</l>
<l>Then as those bright orbs require,</l>
<cb n="2"/>
<l>Fetch her eyesight out of fire;</l>
<l>Like Minerva's, sparkling blue;</l>
<l>Moist, like Cytherea's too;</l>
<l>Give her nose and cheeks a tint</l>
<l>Like shallow milk with roses in't:</l>
<l>Let her lip Persuasion's be.</l>
<l>Asking our's provokingly :</l>
<l>And beneath her satin chin.</l>
<l>With a dimple broken in,</l>
<l>And all about those precious places,</l>
<l>Set a thousand hovering graces.</l>
<l>Now then, — let the drapery spread.</l>
<l>With an under tint of red.</l>
<l>And a glimpse left scarcely drest.</l>
<l>So that what remains be guess'd</l>
<l>'Tis enough: 'tis she! 'tis she!</l>
<l>O thou sweet face, speak to me.</l>
