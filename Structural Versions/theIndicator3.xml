                    <p>We must return a moment to the <placeName type="country" key="Italy" corresp="Italy">Italian</placeName> thieves, to relate a couple of stories
                        related of <persName key="Ludovico Ariosto" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q49250" cert="high"

                            cert="high" type="real" xml:id="tasso">Tasso</persName>. The former was for a short period governor of <placeName
                            type="region" key="Garfaqnana" corresp="Italy"
                            ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1058204" cert="high">Grafagnana</placeName>, a
                        disturbed district in the <placeName type="physical" key="Apennines" corresp="Italy"
                            ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q128604" cert="high">Apennines</placeName>, which his
                        prudent and gentle policy brought back from it's disaffection. Among it's
                        other troubles, were numerous bands of robbers, two of the names of whose
                        leaders, <persName type="fictional">Domenico Maroco</persName>, and <persName type="fictional"
                            xml:id="filippopacchione">Filippo Pacchione</persName>, have come down to posterity.
                            <persName ref="#ariosto">Ariosto</persName>, during the first days of his government, was riding out
                        with a small retinue, when he had to pass through a number of
                        suspicious-looking armed men. The two parties had scarcely cleared each
                        other, when the chief of the strangers asked a servant who happened to be at
                        some distance behind the others, who that person was. <q type="spoken">It is the captain of
                            the citadel here,</q> said the man, <q type="spoken">Lodovico Ariosto.</q> The stranger
                        no sooner heard the name, than he went running back to overtake the
                        governor, who, stopping his horse, waited with some anxiety for the event.
                            <q type="spoken">I beg your pardon, Sir,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">but I was not aware that so
                            great a person as the <rs type="person">Signor <choice><corr>Lodovico</corr><sic>Lodbvico</sic></choice> Ariosto</rs> was passing near me. My name is
                                <persName ref="#filippopacchione">Filippo Pacchione</persName>; and when I knew who it was, I could not go on
                            without returning to pay the respect due to so illustrious a name.</q></p>
                    <p>A doubt is thrown on this story, or rather on the particular person who gave
                        occasion to it, by the similarity of an adventure related of <persName
                            ref="#tasso">Tasso</persName>. Both of them however are very probable, let the
                        similarity be what it may; for both the poets had occasion to go through
                        disturbed districts; robbers abounded in both their times; and the leaders
                        being most probably men rather of desperate fortunes than want of knowledge,
                        were likely enough to seize such opportunities of vindicating their better
                        habits, and shewing a romantic politeness. The enthusiasm too is quite in
                        keeping with the national character; and it is to be observed that the
                        particulars of <persName ref="#tasso">Tasso</persName>'s adventure are different, though the spirit of it
                        is the same. He was journeying, it is said, in company with others, for
                        better security against the banditti who infested the borders of the</p>
                    <pb n="98" />
                    <p>papal territory, when they were told that <persName type="fictional" xml:id="sciarra"
                            >Sciarra</persName>, a famous robber, was at hand in considerable force.
                            <persName ref="#tasso">Tasso</persName> was for pushing on, and defending themselves if
                        attacked; but his opinion was overruled; and the company threw themselves,
                        for safety, into the <placeName type="city" key="Mola" corresp="Italy" cert="high"
                            >city of Mola</placeName>. Here <persName ref="#sciarra">Sciarra</persName> kept them in a manner
                        blocked up ; but hearing that <persName ref="#tasso">Tasso</persName> was among the travellers,
                        he sent him word that he should not only be allowed to pass, but should have
                        safe conduct whithersoever he pleased. The lofty poet, making it a matter of
                        delicacy perhaps to waive an advantage of which his company could not
                        partake, declined the offer, upon which <persName ref="#sciarra">Sciarra</persName> sent another
                        message, saying that upon the sole account of <persName ref="#tasso">Tasso</persName>, the ways
                        should be left open. And they were so.</p>
                    <p>We can call to mind no particular <placeName type="country" key="Germany" corresp="Germany"
                            >German</placeName> thieves, except those who figure in romances, and in
                        the <title level="m" key="The Robbers" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q645484"
                            >Robbers</title> of <persName key="Friedrich Schiller" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22670" cert="high"
                            type="real" xml:id="schiller">Schiller</persName>. To say the truth, we are writing
                        just now with but few books to refer to; and the better informed reader must
                        pardon any deficiences he meets with in these egregious and furtive
                        memorandums. Of the <title level="m" key="The Robbers">Robbers</title> of <persName
                            ref="#schiller">Schiller</persName>, an extraordinary effect is related. It is said to
                        have driven a number of wild-headed young <placeName type="country" key="Germany"
                            corresp="Germany">Germans</placeName> upon playing at banditti, not in the bounds of
                        a school or university, but seriously in a forest. The matter-of-fact
                        spirit in which a <placeName type="country" key="Germany" corresp="Germany">German</placeName> sets
                        about being enthusiastic, is a metaphysical curiosity which modern events
                        render doubly interesting. It is extremely worthy of the attention of those
                        rare personages, entitled reflecting politicians. But we must take care
                        again. It is very inhuman of these politics, that the habit of attending to
                        them, though with the greatest good-will and sincerity, will always be
                        driving a man upon thinking how his fellow-creatures are going on.</p>
                    <p>There is a pleasant well-known story of a <placeName type="country" key="Prussia"
                            corresp="Germany">Prussian</placeName> thief and <persName key="Frederick II of Prussia"
                            ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33400" cert="high" type="real"
                            >Frederick the Second</persName>. [The mention, by the way, of these two
                        personages together puts us in mind of the <placeName type="country" key="Scotland"
                            corresp="United Kingdom">Scottish</placeName> answer to travellers about a <measure
                            unit="mile">mile</measure> and a bittock, â€”the said bittock, or little bit, being
                        perhaps <measure unit="mile" quantity="3">three</measure> or <measure unit="mile" quantity="4"
                            >four miles</measure> in addition.</p>
                    <p><q type="spoken">Reader. There, Mr. Indicator, you get upon politics again.</q><lb/>
                        <q type="spoken">Indic. What, Sir; upon modern politics ?</q><lb/>

                    <p>We forget what was the precise valuable found upon the <placeName type="country"
                            key="Prussia" corresp="Germany">Prussian</placeName> soldier, and missed from an
                        <rs type="religiousObject">image of the Virgin Mary</rs>; but we believe it was a ring. He
                        was tried for sacrilege, and the case appeared clear against him, when he
                        puzzled his Catholic judges by informing them, that the fact was, the <rs
                            type="religiousObject">Virgin Mary</rs> had given him that ring. Here was a terrible
                        dilemma. To dispute the possibility or even probability of a gift from the
                            <rs type="religiousObject">Virgin Mary</rs>, was to deny their religion: while, on the
                        other hand, to let the fellow escape on the pretence, was to canonize
                        impudence itself. The worthy judges, in</p>
                    <pb n="99" />
                    <p>their perplexity, applied to the king, who under the guise of behaving
                        delicately to their faith, was not sorry to have such an opportunity of
                        joking it. His majesty therefore pronounced, with becoming gravity, that the
                        allegation of the soldier could not but have it's due weight with all
                        Catholic believers; but that in future, it was forbidden any <placeName
                            type="country" key="Prussia" corresp="Germany">Prussian</placeName> subject, military
                        or civil, to accept a present from the <rs type="religiousObject">Virgin Mary</rs>.</p>
                    <p>The district, formerly rendered famous by the exploits of <persName key="Skanderbeg"
                            ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q200720" cert="high" type="real"

                        the tyranny of <persName key="Ali Pasha of Ioannina" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q310384"
                            cert="high" type="real">Ali Bey</persName>, has been very fertile in robbers. And no
                        wonder, for a semi-barbarous people so governed become thieves by necessity.
                        The name indeed, as well as profession, is in such good receipt with an
                            <placeName type="country" key="Albania" corresp="Albania">Albanian</placeName>, that
                        according to late travellers, it is a common thing for him to begin a story
                        by saying, <q type="spoken">When I was a robber---</q> We remember reading of some
                            <placeName type="country" key="Albania" corresp="Albania">Albanian</placeName> or <placeName type="country" key="Slavonia" corresp="Croatia"

                    <p>There are some other nations who are all thieves, more or less; or comprise
                        such numbers of them as very much militate against the national character.
                        Such are the piratical <placeName type="country" key="Malaysia" corresp="Malaysia"
                            >Malays</placeName>; the still more infamous <placeName type="country" key="Algeria"

                            corresp="Ethiopia">Abyssinia</placeName>. As to the <placeName type="country" key="Arabia"
                            corresp="Middle East">Arabs</placeName>, they have a prescriptive right, from tradition
                        as well as local circumstances, to plunder every body. The sanguinary
                        ruffians of <placeName type="city" key="Ashanti" corresp="Ghana"
                            ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q210740" cert="high">Ashantee</placeName> and other

                        thieves. They are the next ruffians perhaps in existence, to slave dealers.
                        The gentlest nation of pilferers are the <placeName type="country" key="Tahiti"

                    <p>There is, to be sure, a very eminent instance of a single theft in the <title

                        book; for he suffered a girl to be charged with and punished for the theft,
                        and maintained the lie to her face, though she was his friend, and appealed
                        to him with tears. But it may be said for him, at any rate, that the world
                        would not have known the story but for himself: and if such a disclosure be
                        regarded by some as an additional offence (which it may be thought by some
                        very delicate as well as dishonest people), we must recollect, that it was
                        the object of his book to give a plain unsophisticated account of a human

                        see, at any rate, what has been suspected of more orthodox persons than
                            <persName ref="#rousseau">Rousseau</persName>; to say nothing of less charitable
                        advantages which might be taken of such opinions. He committed a petty
                        theft; and miserably did his false shame, the parent of so many crimes, make
                        him act. But he won back to their infants' lips the bosoms of thousands of
                        mothers. He restored to their bereaved and helpless owners thousands of those
                        fountains of health and joy: and before he is abused, even for worse things
                        than the theft, let those whose virtue consists in custom, think of this.</p>

                        favourite trinkets or keepsakes, for which they chose to appeal to him with
                            <q type="distinct">their most sweet voices.</q></p>
                    <pb n="103" />
                    <p>It was in this character that he performed an exploit, which is the eternal
                        feather in the cap of highway gentility. We will relate it in the words of
                        our informer. Riding out with some of his confederates, <q type="written">he
                            overtakes a coach, which they had set over night, having intelligence of
                            a booty of four hundred pounds in it. In the coach was a knight, his
                            lady, and only one serving-maid, who, perceiving five horsemen making up
                            to them, presently imagined that they were beset; and they were confirmed
                            in this apprehension, by seeing them whisper to one another, and ride
                            backwards and forwards. The lady, to shew she was not afraid, takes a
                            flageolet out of her pocket, and plays: <persName ref="#claudeduval">Du Vall</persName>
                            takes the hint, plays also, and excellently well, upon a flageolet of
                            his own, and in this posture he rides up to the coach-side. <q

                            the knight, <persName ref="#claudeduval">Du Vall</persName> leaps lightly off his horse,
                            and hands the lady out of the coach. They danced, and here it was that
                                <persName ref="#claudeduval">Du Vall</persName> performed marvels; the best master

                                not,</q> replies the knight, and putting his hand under the seat of
                            the coach, pulls out a hundred pounds in a bag, and delivers it to him;
                            which <persName ref="#claudeduval">Du Vall</persName> took with a very good grace, and
                            courteously answered, <q type="spoken">Sir, you are liberal, and shall have no
                                cause to repent your being so; this liberality of yours shall
                                excuse you the other three hundred pounds,</q> and, giving him the
                            word, that if he met with any more of the crew, he might pass
                            undisturbed, he civilly takes his leave of him.</q></p>
                    <p><q type="written">This story, I confess, justifies the great kindness the ladies had for

                            are contained all things that set a man off advantageously, and make him
                            appear, as the phrase is, much a gentleman. First, here was valour, that
                            he and but four more durst assault a knight, a lady, a
                            waiting-gentlewoman, a lacquey, a groom that rid by to open the gates,
                            and the coachman, they being six to five, odds at football; and besides,
                                <persName ref="#claudeduval">Du Vall</persName> had much the worst cause, and reason
                            to believe, that whoever should arrive, would range themselves on the
                            enemy's party. Then he shewed his invention and sagacity, that he could
                                <hi rend="italic">sur le champ</hi>, and, without studying, make that advantage
                            of the lady's playing on the flageolet. He evinced his skill in
                            instrumental music, by playing on his flageolet; in vocal by his
                            singing ; for (as I should have told you before) there being no violins,
                                <persName ref="#claudeduval">Du Vall</persName> sung the currant himself. <q
                                type="written">He manifested his agility of body, by lightly dismounting off his

                                in the whole discourse with the knight and lady, the greatest part

                    <p>This is an article for the reader to think of, when he or she is warm in
                        bed, a little before he goes to sleep, the clothes at his ear, and the wind
                        moaning in some distant crevice.</p>

                            type="fictional">Sancho</persName>, <q type="spoken">on him that first invented sleep!
                            It wraps a man all round like a cloak.</q> It is a delicious moment
                        certainly,â€”that of being well nestled in bed, and feeling that you shall
                        drop gently to sleep. The good is to come, not past: the limbs have been
                        just tired enough, to render the remaining in one posture delightful: the
                        labour of the day is done. A gentle failure of the perceptions comes
                        creeping over one:--the spirit of consciousness disengages itself more and
                        more, with slow and hushing degrees, like a mother detaching her hand from
                        that of her sleeping child;â€”the mind seems to have a balmy lid closing over
                        it, like the eye;â€”'tis closing; â€”'tis more closing;â€”'tis closed. The
                        mysterious spirit has gone to take it's airy rounds.</p>
                    <p>It is said that sleep is best before midnight: and <persName key="Nature"
                            type="myth">Nature</persName> herself, with her darkness and chilling dews, informs
                        us so. There is another reason for going to bed betimes : for it is
                        universally acknowledged that lying late in the morning is a great shortener
                        of life. At least, it is never found in company with longevity. It also
                        tends to make people corpulent. But these matters belong rather to the
                        subject of early rising, than of sleep.</p>
                    <p>Sleep at a late hour in the morning, is not half so pleasant as the more
                        timely one. It is sometimes however excusable, especially to a, watchful or
                        over-worked head; neither can we deny the seducing merits of <q
                            type="distinct">t' other doze,</q>â€” the pleasing wilfulness of nestling
                        in a new posture, when you know you ought to be up, like the rest of the
                        house. But then you cut up the day, and your sleep the next night.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the day, few people think of sleeping, except after dinner ;
                        and then it is often rather a hovering and nodding on the borders of sleep,
                        than a sleep itself. This is a privilege, allowable, we think, to none but
                        the old, or the sickly, or the very tired and care-worn ; and it should be
                        well understood, before it is exercised in company. To escape into slumber
                        from an argument; or to take</p>
                    <pb n="106" />
                    <p>it as an affair of course, only between you and your biliary duct; or to
                        assent with involuntary nods to all that you have just been <choice><corr>disputing;
                        </corr><sic>disputing 5</sic></choice> is not so well: much less, to sit nodding and
                        tottering beside a lady; or to be in danger of dropping your head into the
                        fruit-plate or your host's face; or of waking up, and saying <q
                            type="spoken">Just so</q> to the bark of a dog, or <q type="spoken">Yes, Madam</q> to
                        the black at your elbow.</p>
                    <p>Care-worn people however might refresh themselves oftener with day-sleep than
                        they do; if their bodily state is such as to dispose them to it. It is a
                        mistake to suppose that all care is wakeful. People sometimes sleep, as well
                        as wake, by reason of their sorrow. The difference seems to depend upon the
                        nature of their temperament ; though in the most excessive cases, sleep is
                        perhaps <persName key="Nature" type="myth">Nature</persName>'s never-failing relief, as
                        swooning is upon the rack. A person with jaundice in his blood shall lie
                        down and go to sleep at noon-day, when another of a different complexion
                        shall find his eyes as uncloseable as a statue's, though he has had no sleep
                        for nights together. Without meaning to lesson the dignity of suffering,
                        which has quite enough to do with it's waking hours, it is this that may
                        often account for the profound sleeps enjoyed the night before hazardous
                        battles, executions, and other demands upon an over-excited spirit.</p>
                    <p>The most complete and healthy sleep that can be taken in the day, is in
                        summer-time, out in a field. There is perhaps no solitary sensation so
                        exquisite as that of slumbering on the grass or hay, shaded from the hot sun
                        by a tree, with the consciousness of a fresh but light air running through
                        the wide atmosphere, and the sky stretching far overhead upon all sides.
                            <placeName type="physical">Earth</placeName>, and heaven, and a placid humanity, seem
                        to have the creation to themselves. There is nothing between the slumberer,
                        and the naked and glad innocence of nature.</p>
                    <p>Next to this, but at a long interval, the most, relishing snatch of slumber
                        out of bed, is the one which a tired person takes, before he retires for the
                        night, while lingering in his sitting-room. The consciousness of being very
                        sleepy and of having the power to go to bed immediately, gives great zest to
                        the unwillingness to move. Sometimes he sits nodding in his chair; but the
                        sudden and leaden jerks of the head to which a state of great sleepiness
                        renders him liable, are generally too painful for so luxurious a moment; and
                        he gets into a more legitimate posture, sitting sideways with his head on the
                        chair-back, or throwing his legs up at once on another chair, and half
                        reclining. It is curious however to find, how long an inconvenient posture
                        will be borne for the sake of this foretaste of repose. The worst of it is,
                        that on going to bed, the charm sometimes vanishes; perhaps from the colder
                        temperature of the chamber; for a fireside is a great opiate.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the painful positions into which a sleepy lounger will get
                        himself, it is amusing to think of the more fantastic attitudes that so
                        often take place in bed. If we could add any thing to the numberless things
                        that have been said about sleep by the poets, it would be upon this point.
                        Sleep never shews himself a greater</p>
                    <pb n="107" />
                    <p>leveller. A man in his waking moments may look as proud and self-possessed as
                        he pleases. He may walk proudly, he may sit proudly, he may eat his dinner
                        proudly; he may shave himself with an air of infinite superiority; in a word,
                        he may shew himself grand and absurd upon the most trifling occasions. But
                        Sleep plays the petrifying magician. He arrests the proudest lord as well as
                        the humblest clown in the most ridiculous postures: so that if you could draw
                        a grandee from his bed without waking him, no limb-twisting fool in a
                        pantomime should create wilder laughter. The toy with the string between
                        it's legs is hardly a posture-master more extravagant. Imagine a despot
                        lifted up to the gaze of his valets, with his eyes shut, his mouth open, his
                        left hand under his right ear, his other twisted and hanging helplessly before
                        him like an ideot's, one knee lifted up, and the other leg stretched out, or
                        both knees huddled up together; what a scarecrow to lodge majestic power
                        in!</p>
                    <p>But Sleep is kindly, even in his tricks; and the poets have treated him with
                        proper reverence. According to the ancient mythologists, he had even one of
                        the <rs type="mythologicalCreature">Graces</rs> to wife. He had a thousand sons, of whom
                        the chief were <persName key="Morpheus" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105658" cert="high"

                        who held large possessions on the frontiers; and he came for the first time
                        towards the court, not to pay his respects to the new queen, but to give her
                        battle. <persName type="myth" xml:id="doracles">Doracles</persName> (for that was his name)
                        was not much known by the people. He had distinguished himself for as jealous
                        an independence as a subject could well assume; and though he had been of use
                        in repelling invasion during the latter years of the king, had never made his
                        appearance to receive his master's thanks personally. A correspondence
                        however was understood to have gone on between him and several noblemen about
                        the court 3 and there were those, who in spite of his inattention to
                        popularity, suspected that it would go hard with the young queen, when the two
                        armies came face to face.</p>
                    <p>But neither these subtle statesmen, nor the ambitious young soldier <persName
                            ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName>, were aware of the effects to be produced by a
                        strong personal attachment. The young queen, amiable as she was beautiful,
                        had involuntarily baffled his expectations from her courtiers, by exciting in
                        the minds of some a real disinterested regard, while others nourished a hope
                        of sharing her throne instead. At least, they speculated upon becoming, each
                        the favourite minister; and held it a better thing to reign under that title
                        and a charming mistress, than be the servants of a master, wilful and
                        domineering. By the people she was adored; and when she came riding out of
                        her palace, on the morning of the fight, with an unaccustomed spear standing
                        up in it's rest by her side, her diademed hair flowing a little off into the
                        wind, her face paler than usual, but still tinted with it's roses, and a look
                        in which confidence in the love of her subjects, and tenderness for the wounds
                        they were going to encounter, seemed to contend for the expression, â€”the shout
                        which they sent up would have told a stouter heart than a traitor's, that the
                        royal charmer was secure.</p>
                    <p>The queen, during the conflict, remained in a tent upon an eminence, to which
                        the younger leaders vied who should best spur up their smoking horses, to
                        bring her good news from time to time. The battle was short and bloody.
                            <persName ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName> soon found that he had miscalculated his
                        point; and all his skill and resolution could not set the error to rights.

                        to the throne, he would have had a right to it; but the popularity of
                            <persName ref="#daphles">Daphles</persName> supplied her cause with all the ardour,
                        which a lax state of subjection on the part of the more powerful nobles might
                        have denied it. When her troops charged, or made any other voluntary
                        movement, they put all their hearts into their blows; and when they were
                        compelled to await the enemy, they stood as inflexible as walls of iron. It
                        was like hammering upon</p>

                            <persName ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName> was taken prisoner. The queen,
                        re-issuing from her tent, crowned with laurel, came riding down the eminence,
                        and remained at the foot with her generals, while the prisoners were taken
                        by. Her pale face kept as royal a countenance of composed pity as she could
                        manage, while the commoner rebels passed along, aching with their wounded arms
                        fastened behind, and shaking back their bloody and blinding locks for want of
                        a hand to part them. But the blood mounted to her cheeks, when the proud and
                        handsome <persName ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName>, whom she now saw for the first
                        time, blushed deeply as he cast a glance at his female conqueror, and then
                        stepped haughtily along, handling his gilded chains as if they were an
                        indifferent ornament. <q type="thought">I have conquered him,</q> thought she: <q
                            type="thought">it is a heavy blow to so proud a head; and as he looks not
                            unamiable, it might be politic as well as courteous and kind in me to
                            turn his submission into a more willing one.</q> Alas! pity was helping
                        admiration to a kinder set of offices, than the generous-hearted queen
                        suspected. The captive went to his prison, a conqueror after all; for

                        did she hesitate as she went down the stairs; and when she came to the door,
                        she shed a full, but soft, and as it seemed to her a wilful and refreshing
                        flood of tears, humbling herself for her approaching task. When she had
                        entered, she blushed deeply, and then turning as pale, stood for a minute
                        silent and without motion, She then said, <q type="spoken">Thy queen, <persName
                                ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName>, has come to shew thee how kindly she can
                            treat a great and gallant subject, who did not know her</q> and with
                        these words, and almost before she was aware, the prisoner was released, and
                        preparing to go. He appeared surprised, but not off his guard, nor in any
                        temper to be over-grateful. <q type="spoken">Name,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">O queen,

                                kept.</q></q> <persName ref="#daphles">Daphles</persName> moved her lips, but they spoke not.
                        She waved her head and hand with a deadly smile, as if free- ing him from
                        all conditions; and he was turning to go, when she fell senseless on the
                        floor. The haughty warrior raised her with more impatience than goodwill. He
                        could guess at love in a woman; but he had but a mean opinion both of it and
                        her sex; and the deadly struggle in the heart of <persName ref="#daphles"
                            >Daphles</persName> did not help him to distinguish the romantic passion,
                        which had induced her to put all her past and virgin notions of love into his
                        person, from the commonest liking that might flatter his soldierly vanity.</p>
                    <p>The queen, on awaking from her swoon, found herself compelled, in very justice
                        to the intensity of a true passion, to explain how pity had brought it upon
                        her. <q type="spoken">I might ask it,</q> said she, <q type="spoken"><persName
                                ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName>, in return;</q> and here she resumed something

                            find me rejected.</q> And in getting out that hard word, her voice

                        They left the prison; and his full pardon having been proclaimed, the
                        courtiers, with feasts and entertainments, vied who should seem best to
                        approve their mistress's choice; for so they were quick to understand it. The
                        late captive, who was really as graceful and accomplished as a proud spirit
                        would let him be, received and returned all their attention in princely sort;
                        and <persName ref="#daphles">Daphles</persName> was beginning to hope that he might turn a
                        glad eye upon her some day, when news was brought her that he had gone from
                        court, nobody knew whither. The next intelligence was too certain. He had
                        passed the frontiers, and was leaguing with her enemies for another
                        struggle.</p>
                    <p>From that day, gladness, though not kindness, went out of the face of
                            <persName ref="#daphles">Daphles</persName>. She wrote him a letter, without a word of
                        reproach in it, enough to bring back the remotest heart that had the least
                        spark of sympathy; but he only answered it in a spirit, which shewed that he
                        regarded â€¢ the deepest love but as a wanton trifle. That letter touched her
                        kind wits. She had had a paper drawn up, leaving him her throne in case she
                        should die; but some of her ministers, availing themselves of her enfeebled
                        spirit, had summoned a meeting of the nobles, at which she was to preside in
                        the dress she wore on the day of victory; the sight of which, it was thought,
                        with the arguments which they meant to use, would prevail upon the assembly
                        to urge her to a revocation of the bequest. Her women dressed her, while she
                        was almost unconscious of what they were doing, for she had now began to fade
                        quickly, body as well as mind. They put on her the white garments edged with
                        silver waves, in remembrance of the stream of <placeName type="physical"

                        temples, when she sat on horse-back, and saw the prisoner go by. But at sight
                        of it's twisted and withered green, she took it in her hand; and looking about
                        her in her chair with an air of momentary recollection, began picking it, and
                        letting the leaves fall upon the floor. She went on thus, leaf after leaf,
                        looking vacantly downwards; and when she had stripped <choice><corr>the</corr><sic>thie</sic></choice>

                    <p>daughter. The new prince observing the melancholy which he scarcely affected
                        to repress, and seeing him look up occasionally at a picture which had a veil
                        over it, asked him what the picture was that seemed to disturb him so, and why
                        it was veiled. <q type="spoken">If it be the portrait of the late king,</q> said

                                <persName type="myth" xml:id="phorbas">Phorbas</persName>?</q> And at these words,
                        he frowned impatiently. <persName ref="#phorbas">Phorbas</persName>, with a trembling
                        hand, but not for want of courage, withdrew the black covering; and the
                        portrait of <persName ref="#daphles">Daphles</persName>, in all her youth and beauty,
                        flashed upon the eyes of <persName ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName>. It was not a
                        melancholy face. It was drawn before misfortune had touched it, and sparkled
                        with a blooming beauty, in which animal spirits and good-nature contended for
                        predominance. <persName ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName> paused, and seemed struck. <q
                            type="spoken">The possessor of that face,</q> said he, inquiringly, <q
                            type="spoken">could never have been so sorrowful, as I have heard?</q>â€”<q

                        his other guests to withdraw a while, and then told <persName ref="#doracles"
                            >Doracles</persName> how many fond and despairing things the queen had
                        said of him, both before her wits began to fail, and after. <q type="spoken"
                            >Her wits to fail?</q> murmured the king: <q type="spoken">I have known what
                            it is to feel almost a mad impatience of the will; but I knew not that
                            these â€” -- gentle creatures, women, could so feel for such a trifle.</q>
                            <persName ref="#phorbas">Phorbas</persName> brought out the laurel-crown, and told him
                        how it was that the half of it became bare. The impatient blood of <persName
                            ref="#doracles">Doracles</persName> mounted, but not in anger, to his face; and
                        breaking up the party, he requested that the picture might be removed to his
                        own chamber, promising to return it.</p>
                    <p>A whole year however did he keep it; and as he had no foreign enemies to
                        occupy his time, nor was disposed to enter into the common sports of peace,
                        it was understood that he spent the greatest part of his time, when he was
                        not in council, in the room where the picture hung. In truth, the image of
                        the once smiling <persName ref="#daphles">Daphles</persName> haunted him wherever he went;
                        and to ease himself of the yearning of wishing her alive again and seeing her
                        face, he was in the habit of being with it as much as possible. His self-will
                        turned upon him, even in that gentle shape. Millions of times did he wish back
                        the loving author of his fortunes, whom he had treated with so clownish an
                        ingratitude; and millions of times did the sense of the impotence of his wish
                        run up in red hurry to his cheeks, and help to pull them into a gaunt
                        melancholy. But this is not a repaying sorrow to dwell upon. He was one day,
                        after being in vain expected at council, found lying madly on the floor of the
                        room, dead. He had torn the portrait from the wall. His dagger was in his
                        heart; and his cheek lay upon that blooming and smiling face, which had it been
                        living, would never have looked so at being revenged.</p>

                        himself on the same attribute, proves little; for he was a cold-blooded man
                        of the world, and could play the hypocrite for the worst and most despotic
                        purposes. Did he now and then lecture his poetical friends upon this point,
                        respecting their own appearances with the world ? There is a curious <rs

                        compelled to give up his sceptical notions, and to attend more to public
                        worship, because it had thundered one day when, the sky was cloudless. The

                        would serve his purpose on either side of the question.</p>
                    <p>The opinions of the ancients upon religion may be divided into three general
                        classes. The great multitude believed any thing; the very few disbelieved
                        every thing, the philosophers and poets entertained a refined natural
                        religion, which while it pronounced upon nothing, rejected what was evidently
                        unworthy of the spirit; of the creation, and regarded the popular deities, as
                        personifications of it's various workings. All these classes had their
                        extravagances, in proportion to their ignorance, or viciousness, or
                        metaphysical, perplexity. The multitude, whose notions were founded on
                        ignorance, habit, and fear, admitted many absurd and some cruel imaginations.
                        The mere man of the world measured every thing by his own vain and petty
                        standard, and thought the whole goods of the universe a scramble for the
                        cunning and hypocritical. The over-refining followers of <persName key="Plato"

                        impatient eyes; and lost themselves in the ethereal dogmatisms of <persName

                    <p><placeName type="ancient">ancient mythology</placeName>, is in a mingled sense of the old
                        popular belief and of the philosophical refinements upon it. We take
                            <persName key="Apollo" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q31034" cert="high"
                            type="myth">Apollo</persName>, and <persName key="Hermes" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q40974" cert="high"

                            type="myth">Venus</persName>, as shapes that existed in popular credulity, as the
                        greater fairies <choice><corr>of</corr><sic>bf</sic></choice> the ancient world; and we regard them, at the same
                        time, as personifications of all that is beautiful and genial in the forms
                        and tendencies of creation. But the result, coming as it does too through
                        avenues of beautiful poetry, both ancient and modern, is so entirely
                        chearful, that we are apt to think it must have wanted gravity to more
                        believing eyes. We fancy that the old world saw nothing in religion but
                        lively and graceful shapes, as remote from the more obscure and awful
                        hintings of the world unknown, as physics appear to be from the metaphysical;
                        â€”as the eye of a beautiful woman is from the inward speculations of a
                            <placeName type="country" key="Brahmin" corresp="India">Brahmin</placeName>; or a lily
                        at noon-day from the wide obscurity of night-time.</p>
                    <p>This supposition appears to be carried a great deal too far. We will not
                        enquire in this place, how far the mass of mankind, when these shapes were
                        done away, did or did not escape from a despotic anthropomorphitism; nor how
                        far they were driven by the vaguer fears, and the opening of a more visible
                        eternity, into avoiding the whole subject, rather than courting it; nor how
                        it is, that the nobler practical religion which was afforded them, has been
                        unable to bring back their frightened theology from the angry and avaricious
                        pursuits into which they fled for refuge. But setting aside the portion of
                        terror, of which heathenism partook in common with all faiths originating in
                        uncultivated times, the ordinary run of pagans were perhaps more impressed
                        with a sense of the invisible world, in consequence of the very visions
                        presented to their imagination, than the same description of men under a more
                        shadowy system. There is the same difference between the two things, as
                        between a populace believing in fairies, and a populace not believing. The
                        latter is in the high road to something better, if not drawn aside into new
                        terrors on the one hand, or mere worldliness on the other. But the former is
                        led to look out of the mere worldly commonplaces about it, twenty times to the
                        other's once. It has a sense of a supernatural state of things, however gross.
                        It has a link with another world, from which somethink like gravity is sure to
                        strike into the most chearful heart. Every forest, to the mind's eye of a
                            <placeName type="country" key="Greece" corresp="Greece">Greek</placeName>, was haunted
                        with superior intelligences. Every stream had it's presiding nymph, who was
                        thanked for the draught of water. Every house had it's protecting gods, which
                        had blessed the inmate's ancestors; and which would bless him also, if he
                        cultivated the social affections: for the same word which expressed piety
                        towards the Gods, expressed love towards relations and friends. If in all this
                        there was nothing but the worship of a more graceful humanity, there may be
                        worships much worse as well as much better. And the divinest spirit that ever
                        appeared on earth has told us, that the extension of human sympathy embraces
                        all that is required of us, either to do or to foresee.</p>

                        approaching nearer every instant to the presence of the divinity, and not

                        himself going by. This is mere poetry to us, and very fine it is; but to him
                        it was poetry, and religion, and beauty, and gravity, and hushing awe, and a
                        path as from one world to another.</p>
                    <p>With similar feelings he would cross the ocean, an element that naturally

                    <p>In all this, there is a deeper sense of another world, than in the habit of

                        benignities, it's mystery. It was a strong sense of this, which made a
                        living poet, who is accounted very orthodox in his religious opinions, give

                        seems to have dreaded the symptom, as an evidence of materialism, and of the

                    <p>Some people say it is a very easy thing to get up of a cold morning. You have
                        only, they tell you, to take the resolution; and the thing is done. This may
                        be very true; just as a boy at school has only to take a flogging, and the
                        thing is over. But we have not at all made up our minds upon it; and we find
                        it a very pleasant exercise to discuss the matter, candidly, before we get
                        up. This at least is not idling, though it may be lying. It affords an
                        excellent answer to those, who ask how lying in bed can be indulged in by a
                        reasoning being,â€”a rational creature. How? Why with the argument calmly at
                        work in one's head, and the clothes over one's shoulder. Ohâ€”it is a fine way
                        of spending a sensible, impartial half-hour.</p>
                    <p>If these people would be more charitable, they would get on with their
                        argument better. But they are apt to reason so ill, and to assert so
                        dogmatically, that one could wish to have them stand round one's bed of a
                        bitter morning, and lie before their faces. They ought to hear both sides of
                        the bed, the inside and out. If they cannot entertain themselves with their
                        own thoughts for half an hour or so, it is not the fault of those who can.
                        If their will is never pulled aside by the enticing arms of imagination, so
                        much the luckier for the stage-coachman.</p>
                    <p>Candid inquirers into one's decumbency, besides the greater or less
                        privileges to be allowed a man in proportion to his ability of keeping early
                        hours, the work given his faculties, &amp;c., will at least concede their
                        due merits to such representations as the following. In the first place, says
                        the injured but calm appealer, I have been warm all night, and find my system
                        in a state perfectly suitable to a warm-blooded animal. To get out of this
                        state into the cold, besides the inharmonious and uncritical abruptness of the
                        transition, is so unnatural to such a creature, that the poets, refining upon
                        the tortures of the damned, make one of their greatest agonies consist in
                        being suddenly transported from heat to cold,â€”from fire to ice. They are <q

                        up, I find that such parts of the sheets and bolster, as are exposed to the
                        air of the room, are stone cold. On opening my eyes, the first thing that
                        meets them is my own breath rolling forth, as if in the open air, like smoke
                        out of a cottage-chimney. Think of this symptom. Then I turn my eyes sideways
                        and see the window all frozen over. Think of that. Then the servant comes

                        troublesome.) <q type="spoken">Ohâ€” the shirtâ€”you must air my clean

                        barometer. An ingenious lier in bed will find hard matter of discussion even
                        on the score of health and longevity. He will ask us for our proofs and
                        precedents of the ill effects of lying later in cold weather; and sophisticate
                        much on the advantages of an even temperature of body; of the natural
                        propensity (pretty universal) to have one's way; and of the animals that roll
                        themselves up and sleep all the winter. As to longevity, he will ask whether

                    <p>We only know of one confounding, not to say confounded argument, fit to

                        question. A lier in bed may be allowed to profess a disinterested
                        indifference for his health or longevity; but while he is shewing the
                        reasonableness of consulting his own, or one person's comfort, he must admit
                        the proportionate claim of more than one; and the best way to deal with him
                        is this, especially for a lady; for we earnestly recommend the use of that sex
                        on such occasions, if not somewhat over-persuasive; since extremes have an
                        awkward knack of meeting. First then, admit all the ingeniousness of what he
                        says, telling him that the bar has been deprived of an excellent lawyer. Then
                        look at him in the most goodnatured manner in the world, with a mixture of
                        assent and appeal in your countenance, and tell him that you are waiting
                        breakfast for him; that you never like to breakfast without him; that you
                        really want it too; that the servents want theirs; that you shall not know
                        how to get the house into order, unless he rises; and that you are sure he
                        would do things twenty times worse, even than getting out of his warm bed, to
                        put them all into good humour and a state of comfort. Then, after having said
                        this, throw in the comparatively indifferent matter, to him, about his health;
                        but tell him that it is no indifferent matter to you; that the sight of his
                        illness makes more people suffer than one; but that if nevertheless, he really
                        does feel so very sleepy and so very much refreshed by----Yet stay; we hardly

                    <p>Other little helps of appeal may be thrown in, as occasion requires. You may
                        tell a lover for instance, that lying in bed makes people corpulent; a
                        father, that you wish, him to complete the fine manly example he sets his
                        children; a lady, that she will injure her bloom or her shape, which M. or
